    <p>Matt Haskell at Spaceflight Insider marked yesterday&#8217;s anniversary with <a href="https://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-flight-history/wings-of-exploration-reflecting-on-the-40th-anniversary-of-the-space-shuttle/">an outstanding column on the history of the program:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  The morning of April 12, 1981, proved to be a history-making event. For many, that day stemmed careers, dreams and imaginations alike. On that inaugural launch day began 30 years of advances in spaceflight, technology, scientific research, and would eventually lead to a permanent presence of humanity in space, but not without tragedy. This is the story of the Space Shuttle.

<blockquote><p>
  If you create a site or page name in iWeb 1.0.1 with an apostrophe as part of the name, and subsequently update to iWeb 1.1, then the web addresses (URLs) to your site/page will no longer be valid. This will break any existing bookmarks to the page. This occurs because iWeb 1.1 handles apostrophes differently than iWeb 1.0.1.</p>
<p>  People who bookmarked your iWeb 1.0.1 site need to bookmark your new site published with iWeb 1.1.

    <p>Lauren Goode has published <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem/">an amazing piece at Wired</a> about calling off her wedding, yet being reminded about it over and over from algorithm-powered services from Facebook, Pinterest and even Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I still have a photograph of the breakfast I made the morning I ended an eight-year relationship and canceled a wedding. It was an unremarkable breakfast—a fried egg—but it is now digitally fossilized in a floral dish we moved with us when we left New York and headed west. I don’t know why I took the photo, except, well, I do: I had fallen into the reflexive habit of taking photos of everything.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This column really hit me <em>hard.</em></p>
<p>Over the last several years, I&#8217;ve been dealing with something similar. While not a broken engagement, I&#8217;ve been stopped in my tracks any time I come across — or am shown by a computer — photos of the time before our oldest son was diagnosed with brain cancer. When a photo would show up, I would tell my phone I didn&#8217;t want to be reminded of it anymore, but it would still be burned into my brain hours or even days later.</p>
<p>That diagnosis came when he turned six months old, but in photos leading up to it, I can see the symptoms clearly. His head is often turned to the side. He can&#8217;t quite lift his eyes to meet the camera.</p>
<p>Of course, back then, we didn&#8217;t know these were signs of something life-threatening. In fact, we didn&#8217;t know enough about the world of neurology to notice them at all. The truth is, no normal parents would have seen them.</p>
<p>Like the slow-growing fractures in a doomed relationship, these symptoms were subtle and hard to detect until one day they weren&#8217;t, and he was suddenly having an MRI.</p>
<p>When the Photos app creates a memory with one of those pre-diagnosis photos, it hits me like a train. I feel guilt and shame that we didn&#8217;t see things sooner. I focus on those feelings rather than the good. The truth is that his cancer was caught, he underwent life-saving treatment at St. Jude and today he is 12 years old and doing well.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;d rather sink into the misery of the past than feel the warmth of hope and thankfulness here in the present.</p>
<p>At the end of 2019, I knew this was a problem that needed addressing. I felt chained to the past, unable to move forward. It was like a weight threatening to pull me under and to be perfectly honest, I would have been okay with that outcome most days. I was barely treading water, and I needed help. I saw my doctor and restarted medication, and have been working on dealing with these issues in the safe bounds of therapy, armed with a PTSD diagnosis. Some weeks it feels like I&#8217;m digging through wet sand, watching it slump back into the pit, but progress is being made thanks to many people in my life.</p>
<p>I share this to say this: if you like me have memories that you can&#8217;t move past, there&#8217;s hope. The darkness doesn&#8217;t have to win.</p>

All users will be able to send payments today, and we’ll be rolling out the ability to receive payments in waves, starting with a small test group today. Our hope is to collect feedback, fine-tune the feature, and roll it out to everyone soon.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A user can select a creator and the amount they want to send. They give Clubhouse a debit or credit card for payment, then the money is sent:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The person sending the money will also be charged a small card processing fee, which will go directly to our payment processing partner, Stripe. Clubhouse will take nothing.

  When Apple makes the switch to ARM, they will have total control of their own destiny – just the way they like it.

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>As soon as I unboxed my new MacBook Air, I knew there’d be one problem I’d have to get around: Apple had assigned a special action to every function key.</p>
<p><img alt="MacBook Air function keys" class="ss" src="http://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210404-MacBook%20Air%20function%20keys.jpg" title="MacBook Air function keys" width="95%" /></p>
<p>Every Mac keyboard I’d used before this one had some empty function keys in the middle of the row. And for at least a decade, I had mapped one of them, <span class="menu">F5</span>, to the Show Desktop action. The Desktop is a convenient spot to save temporary files, and dragging them to and from the Desktop is most easily done when you have a simple way to show and hide all your windows while in the middle of a drag. Mapping the Show Desktop toggle to <span class="menu">F5</span> gave me that simple way. And it’s become such a regular part of how I use a Mac that I was afraid I couldn’t retrain myself to use anything else.</p>
<p>I tried. For a couple of weeks, I had Show Desktop mapped to ⌥⌘D, but it never felt right. There’s a certain “pat your head while you rub your belly” aspect to using a three-finger keyboard combination with one hand while dragging with the other. I know it sounds silly, but the added work of arranging my left hand to press more than one key often made my right hand drop what it was dragging. Old dog, new tricks.</p>
<p>So this meant I had to do what I was hoping to avoid: turn on the dreaded “Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys” setting.</p>
<p><img alt="Keyboard settings for function keys" class="ss" src="http://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210403-Keyboard%20settings%20for%20function%20keys.png" title="Keyboard settings for function keys" width="80%" /></p>
<p>(By the way, has anyone at Apple read the text of this option carefully? Why would my MacBook Air’s keyboard be considered external? Even on an iMac or Mac Pro, I wouldn’t think of the keyboard that comes with the computer as external. An external keyboard is what I use when working on my iPad.)</p>
<p>There are two reasons I have always avoided turning on the standard function key setting:</p>
<ol>
<li>I use some of the special actions quite often, especially the volume control keys over at the right end. Using the <span class="menu">fn</span> key with them is inconvenient because it’s a two-handed action.</li>
<li>It’s clear that Apple expects you to keep that option turned off, and I have learned over the years that doing things outside Apple’s expectations often leads to weird behavior.<sup id="fnref:windows"><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fn:windows" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>But I <em>really</em> wanted <span class="menu">F5</span> to Show Desktop, so I clicked the checkbox and mapped <span class="menu">F5</span> the way I wanted. That worked fine, but as I had feared, it ruined other behavior.</p>
<p>According to the description,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this option is selected, press the Fn key to use the special features printed on each key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was true for the volume and brightness control keys, but not for Spotlight (<span class="menu">F4</span>), Dictation (<span class="menu">F5</span>) or Do Not Disturb (<span class="menu">F6</span>). Pressing these keys along with <span class="menu">fn</span> did absolutely nothing after activating the standard function key setting. So I had to work through all the settings (and do a little work in Keyboard Maestro) to get reasonable access to all the features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spotlight is now ⌃␣ (Control-Space). This is in <span class="menu">Settings▸Keyboard▸Shortcuts▸Spotlight</span>.</li>
<li>Dictation is now two presses of the Right ⌘ key. This is in <span class="menu">Settings▸Keyboard▸Dictation</span>.</li>
<li>Do Not Disturb is <span class="menu">F6</span> (which matches the printing on the key). This is in <span class="menu">Settings▸Keyboard▸Shortcuts▸Mission Control</span>.</li>
<li>Mission Control (what used to be Exposé) is <span class="menu">F3</span> (which matches the printing on the key. This is in <span class="menu">Settings▸Keyboard▸Shortcuts▸Mission Control</span>.</li>
<li>Application Windows is <span class="menu">F4</span>. This is in <span class="menu">Settings▸Keyboard▸Shortcuts▸Mission Control</span>.</li>
<li>Show Desktop (that’s where we started, remember?) is <span class="menu">F5</span>. This is in <span class="menu">Settings▸Keyboard▸Shortcuts▸Mission Control</span>.</li>
<li>Toggle Mute is <span class="menu">F10</span> (which matches the printing on the key). This was done through a Keyboard Maestro macro that uses the <span class="menu">Toggle System Sound Mute</span> action.</li>
<li>Volume Down is <span class="menu">F11</span> (which matches the printing on the key). This was done through a Keyboard Maestro macro that uses the <span class="menu">Decrease System Sound Volume</span> action.</li>
<li>Volume Up is <span class="menu">F12</span> (which matches the printing on the key). This was done through a Keyboard Maestro macro that uses the <span class="menu">Increase System Sound Volume</span> action.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven’t bothered remapping <span class="menu">F1</span> or <span class="menu">F2</span> because I very seldom change the screen brightness.</p>
<p>The two Mission Control actions I’ve mapped to <span class="menu">F3</span> and <span class="menu">F4</span> don’t get used as much as <span class="menu">F5</span>, but they’re very helpful in digging out buried windows, especially on a small notebook screen where there’s lots of overlap. And there’s a logic to their positioning helps me remember what they do, even for the two that don’t have their function printed on the key.</p>
<p><img alt="Function key actions" class="ss" src="http://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210403-Function%20key%20actions.jpg" title="Function key actions" width="75%" /></p>
<p>Was all this dicking around worth it? I think so. Hesitating over common operations doesn’t just waste time; it makes you shift your thinking back and forth between what you’re working on and the mechanical operation of your computer. Almost anything that keeps you focused is worth it.</p>
<p>I will feel a little foolish if someone emails me and says “Why didn’t you just do X?” and they have a way of getting <span class="menu">F5</span> mapped to Show Desktop without going through all the rest of this nonsense. But if there is an easier way, I’ll happily adopt it.</p>

    <p>This morning, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-arcade-expands-its-award-winning-catalog-to-more-than-180-games/">Apple announced</a> 30 new titles for Apple Arcade, bringing the total to 180 games as part of the $5/month service. Some of these games are new, and some are &#8230; not.</p>
<p>John Voorhees at MacStories <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-arcade-expands-more-originals-and-ios-classics/">has details:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Second, Arcade includes two new game categories: Timeless Classics and App Store Greats, which are a big collection of all-time favorite iOS games that are now available at no extra cost as part of an Arcade subscription on the iPhone and iPad and differentiated from other titles with the addition of a ‘+’ in their titles. Games included in the category include Zach Gage’s Good Soduku, Mini Metro, Fruit Ninja Classic, Badland, Blek, Flipflop Solitaire, Reigns, Monument Valley, and more. It’s an impressive list of classics that that is great to see spotlighted by Apple and preserved.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I like this direction, and hope to see Apple Arcade be able to bring back more dead-and-gone iPhone games — especially if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Control_(video_game)">Flight Control</a> makes the cut.</p>

    <p>This morning, a new LEGO space shuttle <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/nasa-space-shuttle-discovery-10283">went on sale:</a></p>
<p><img alt="LEGO Shuttle Discovery" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lego-discovery.jpg" /></p>
<p>This model honors STS-31, the flight that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit for the very first time. I love the way the LEGO Hubble looks.</p>
<p>collectSPACE interviewed LEGO designer Milan Madge, who led the project that has resulted in my latest LEGO purchase. <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-040121a-lego-space-shuttle-discovery-designer-interview.html">It&#8217;s a great read,</a> but this bit jumped out at me in particular:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The thing that really inspired that scale was the Hubble Space Telescope and the STS-31 mission because normally, when we do a space shuttle, the payload bay is kind of, well, I don&#8217;t want to say an afterthought, but it&#8217;s often smaller than it should be because of the constraints of working with LEGO bricks.</p>
<p>  Being able to go up to that scale meant that we could get the walls of the shuttle thin enough so that we could keep the Hubble in an accurate scale to the orbiter.</p>
<p>  [&#8230;]</p>
<p>  We would normally not include that level of detail on a LEGO model. But by adding those details and being able to explain some of them through the building instructions, we are really taking people on a bit more of a journey. Hopefully when people build it, they&#8217;ll learn a bit about the shuttle, which they might not have done from a smaller scale model.

  Free for all developers, WWDC21 will offer unique insight into the future of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Building on the record-breaking participation and learnings from last year’s online conference, WWDC21 is an opportunity for developers to learn about the new technologies, tools, and frameworks they rely on to build innovative and platform-differentiating apps and games. Apple also announced that this year’s Swift Student Challenge, an opportunity for young developers to demonstrate their coding skills by creating a Swift playground, is now accepting submissions.

    <p>For months, Software Update on both of my Macs has listed &#8220;Final Cut Pro Content v1.0&#8221; as ready to install, but trying to run the update doesn&#8217;t clear it from the list of available updates. On my Mac Pro, it appears <em>twice</em> which is extra fun:</p>
<p><img alt="Software Update is stuck" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sys-prefs-fcp-update.png" /></p>
<p>In the past, I would have used the <code>ignore</code> flag for the <code>softwareupdate</code> command to hide these updates and just move on with my life, but in Big Sur, <code>ignore</code> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/650369">has been removed,</a> which is frustrating in situations like mine.</p>
<p>To help clear these errant updates, I uninstalled Final Cut Pro, which made Software Update forget about the updates, but reinstalling Final Cut brought them right back.</p>
<p>There is a &#8220;Download Additional Content&#8230;&#8221; command within Final Cut Pro, but selecting it just brings up the same-old problem. Here, my Mac is trying to download both of the listed packages:</p>
<p><img alt="Downloading" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sys-prefs-drunk.png" /></p>
<p>Just like when manually run, they never actually install and return to the list of available updates.</p>
<p>Googling the name of this package brought me to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1394?locale=en_US">this page on Apple&#8217;s website.</a> The text on the site matches what&#8217;s in Software Update, and the size of the package <em>almost</em> matches:<sup id="fnref-22071-fn-size"><a class="jetpack-footnote" href="http://512pixels.net#fn-22071-fn-size">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote><p>
  This update adds the following content for use in Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound Effects: Over 1300 rights-free sound effects installed into the Audio Browser of Final Cut Pro.</li>
<li>Audio Effect Presets: Additional preset effects for the Space Designer plug-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>  This update is recommended for all users of Final Cut Pro.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The weirdest thing on this page is the published date, <strong>which is June 21, 2011.</strong> The update requires 10.6.7 or higher, which my machine definitely meets.</p>
<p>Assuming System Preferences was just broken, I downloaded the package from that support document and ran it manually:</p>
<p><img alt="FPC Content Installer" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fcp-content-update.png" /></p>
<p>After restarting just for good measure, Software Update still lists the package twice.</p>
<p><del>At this point, I&#8217;m not sure where to go next. I assume this has something to do with Apple continuing to make macOS more secure, but I&#8217;d sure like a way to clear the red badge from System Preferences on my Macs.</del></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After getting a helpful email from a reader, I have seem to have fixed this by deleting this folder: <code>Macintosh HD/Library/Applicaion Support/Final Cut Pro/Library/Content</code> and re-running the update. The new version of the folder is the same size as the old one, and its permissions are the same, so I&#8217;m not sure <em>why</em> this fixed my problem, but I&#8217;m glad it did.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn-22071-fn-size">
In System Preferences, the update appears once as 637.1 MB and once as 637.2 MB. On Apple&#8217;s site, the company reports it as 637.3 MB.&#160;<a href="http://512pixels.net#fnref-22071-fn-size">&#8617;</a>

    <p>The best thing about blogging your little automations is that other people see them and come up with improvements. In <a href="https://imagazine.pl/2021/03/29/automatyzacja-pracy-z-tekstem-na-macu/">an article in iMagazine</a>, Wojtek Pietrusiewicz redid <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2021/03/keys-and-case/">my Cocoa keybindings</a> as Keyboard Maestro macros. The article is in Polish, but you shouldn’t have any trouble getting the gist of it.</p>
<p>Wojtek’s macros are better than my keybindings because they work in any app, even those that don’t honor Cocoa keybindings, like Messages, Twitter, and Slack. Of course, they only work if you have Keyboard Maestro, but if you’re serious about Mac automation, you probably do.</p>
<p>Wojtek does the case changing through <a href="https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/manual/Filters">Keyboard Maestro filters</a>. I had never looked at Keyboard Maestro’s Filter action before. It has a remarkable list of transformations:</p>

<p>There are 47 filters in this list, more even than you’ll find in BBEdit’s <span class="menu">Text</span> menu.<sup id="fnref:bbedit"><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fn:bbedit" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’m not sure why I’d never noticed the Filter action before, but now that I have, I won’t forget it.</p>
<p>While Wojtek’s macros are an improvement on my Cocoa keybindings, they don’t replace the AppleScripts I wrote for BBEdit because they don’t handle the situation in which text is already chosen. Wojtek mentions in his article that he plans to add that ability, but I couldn’t wait. I extended his macros to work like my AppleScripts, but in any app.</p>
<p>Here’s the Lower Case macro. The Upper Case and Capitalize macros are the same except for the filter.</p>
<p><img alt="Keyboard Maestro Lower Case macro" class="ss" src="http://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210329-Keyboard%20Maestro%20Lower%20Case%20macro.png" title="Keyboard Maestro Lower Case macro" width="80%" /></p>
<p>The first thing it does is save whatever you have on the system clipboard. We’ll restore that at the end of the macro. It then initializes the clipboard with an empty string—this is necessary to work with the logic of the later steps.</p>
<p>The next step is to simulate a ⌘C keystroke. If there’s text selected, it gets put on the clipboard; if there’s no text selected, the clipboard remains an empty string.</p>
<p>Now we test the contents of the clipboard. If it’s an empty string, we simulate a ⌥⇧← keystroke to select back to the beginning of the word and a ⌘C keystroke to put that text on the clipboard. If the clipboard is <em>not</em> an empty string, we do nothing.</p>
<p>As we leave the macro’s conditional chunk, whatever text we want to change the case of is both selected and on the clipboard. The next two steps change the case of the clipboard and paste it in to replace the selection. Finally, we restore the clipboard to what it was before we started.</p>
<p>Thanks to Wojtek, I now have a set of case-changing macros that work consistently in every app.</p>

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Setting up a new computer from scratch is the perfect opportunity to rethink the way you’ve been working. Because it takes some time to find and import your old scripts and settings, the small amount of extra time it takes to tweak them doesn’t seem like much of a burden. I’ve used the setting up of my M1 MacBook Air to fiddle with my longstanding <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2011/11/capitalization-keybinding/">capitalization keybinding</a>.</p>
<p>As I’ve explained before, I have a problem typing capitalized words. Usually, my pinkies lift off the Shift key a little too soon, and the word ends up all lower case. Sometimes, as I try to correct for that tendency, my pinkies linger too long on the Shift key, and I end up with words that have their first two letters CApitalized. For as long as I’ve used scriptable text editors, I’ve written macros to correct for this tendency. Emacs, NEdit,<sup id="fnref:nedit"><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fn:nedit" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2006/03/capitalize-macro-for-textmate/">TextMate</a>, <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2013/03/capitalize-macro-for-bbedit/">BBEdit</a>—they’ve all been given a way for me to correct my miscapitalizations. The macros have all worked the same way:</p>
<ol>
<li>I realize that I’ve typed part of a word—or maybe the entire word—and didn’t capitalize it.</li>
<li>I type some key combination. For a long time, this has been ⌃⌘C.</li>
<li>The editor goes back to the beginning of the word, capitalizes it, and then resets the cursor to where it was before I typed ⌃⌘C.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the Mac, I can extend this correction to (some) other apps through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/TextFonts/Conceptual/CocoaTextArchitecture/Introduction/Introduction.html">Cocoa text system</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/TextDefaultsBindings/TextDefaultsBindings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000468">keybindings</a>. If you know about keybindings, it’s probably through <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/keybindings/">Brett Terpstra</a>. His <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/KeyBindings">huge set of keybindings</a> is unquestionably the best set of examples you can find on the topic, but I still think Jacob Rus’s old web pages (<a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/cocoa-text.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/selectors.html">here</a>) are the best tutorials.</p>
<p>So anyway, after a couple of days of using my new MacBook Air, I realized that my typing of capitalized words hadn’t improved, and I needed to install both my BBEdit capitalization macro and my keybindings file. As I was doing so, I thought about extending them. For example, I’ve run into situations when I needed ALL CAPS, but I didn’t press the Caps Lock key long enough for it to activate, and I’d type <code>path</code> in a shell script instead of PATH. And if I were going to add an uppercase keybinding, I might as well add a lowercase one while I was at it.</p>
<p>Writing the commands was simple enough (I’ll show them later)—what was tricky was deciding where to bind them. I took inspiration from the X, C, and V keys used for Cut, Copy, and Paste. They work because they’re all in a row, they’re in the same order as we usually list the functions, and two of the keys have a nominal relationship to their function. I chose three keys at the other end of the lower row: &lt;, &gt;, and ?.</p>
<p><img alt="Case keys" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210301-Case%20keys.jpg" title="Case keys" width="75%" /></p>
<p>The relationship between the names of these keys and their function is tenuous, but the &lt; key can be related to the idea of “making what’s to the left smaller” and the &gt; key to “make what’s to the left larger.” More important is that the order of the keys from left to right is the order I associate with case changing: Lowercase, Uppercase, Capitalize.</p>
<p>Of course, I can’t just combine the Command key with these to run my macros. ⌘-Period has been used to cancel commands for as long as the Mac has been around.<sup id="fnref:period"><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fn:period" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> And ⌘-Comma is the standard shortcut for opening an app’s preferences window. So, to hold onto some connection with my older use of ⌃⌘C, I chose to combine Control and Command to the three keys.</p>
<p>The Cocoa text system keybindings are saved in <code>~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code>. This is a plain text file that’s formatted in a way that’s reminiscent of JSON.</p>
<pre><code>{
    "^@," = (setMark:, moveWordLeft:, moveRight:, lowercaseWord:, swapWithMark:);
    "^@." = (setMark:, moveWordLeft:, moveRight:, uppercaseWord:, swapWithMark:);
    "^@/" = (setMark:, moveWordLeft:, moveRight:, capitalizeWord:, swapWithMark:);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The keybindings come before the equals sign, and the caret and at symbol are ASCII substitutes for Control and Command. After that come the series of <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/selectors.html">Cocoa text selectors</a> that do the work of moving the cursor around and changing case.</p>
<p>These keybindings work in apps that use the Cocoa text system and honor the keybindings. Luckily for me, that includes many of the apps I write in, especially Mail. It doesn’t include the app I do <em>most</em> of my writing in, BBEdit, but that’s OK because BBEdit has a very capable AppleScript dictionary, which can do everything the keybindings can do and more. Here are the scripts for Lowercase,</p>
<pre><code>applescript:
 1:  tell application "BBEdit"
 2:    tell window 1
 3:      if length of selection is 0 then
 4:        set cursorPoint to characterOffset of selection
 5:        find "\\b\\w" options {search mode:grep, backwards:true} with selecting match
 6:        find "\\w+\\b" options {search mode:grep, extend selection:true} with selecting match
 7:        change case selection making lower case with replacing target
 8:        select insertion point before character cursorPoint
 9:      else
10:        change case selection making lower case with replacing target
11:      end if
12:    end tell
13:  end tell
</code></pre>
<p>Uppercase,</p>
<pre><code>applescript:
 1:  tell application "BBEdit"
 2:    tell window 1
 3:      if length of selection is 0 then
 4:        set cursorPoint to characterOffset of selection
 5:        find "\\b\\w" options {search mode:grep, backwards:true} with selecting match
 6:        find "\\w+\\b" options {search mode:grep, extend selection:true} with selecting match
 7:        change case selection making raise case with replacing target
 8:        select insertion point before character cursorPoint
 9:      else
10:        change case selection making raise case with replacing target
11:      end if
12:    end tell
13:  end tell
</code></pre>
<p>and Capitalize</p>
<pre><code>applescript:
 1:  tell application "BBEdit"
 2:    tell window 1
 3:      if length of selection is 0 then
 4:        set cursorPoint to characterOffset of selection
 5:        find "\\b\\w" options {search mode:grep, backwards:true} with selecting match
 6:        find "\\w+\\b" options {search mode:grep, extend selection:true} with selecting match
 7:        change case selection making capitalize words with replacing target
 8:        select insertion point before character cursorPoint
 9:      else
10:        change case selection making capitalize words with replacing target
11:      end if
12:    end tell
13:  end tell
</code></pre>
<p>You’ll note that these scripts behave differently under different conditions. If there’s no selection, they work just like the keybindings: jump back to the beginning of the word, change the case, and return the cursor to where it was. But if text is selected, they do something simpler: change the case of whatever is selected. This makes it easy to change the case of a whole set of words at once.</p>
<p>Have I occasionally typed ⌃⌘C instead of ⌃⌘/ over the past few weeks? Of course I have—you don’t break a 15-year habit overnight. But I’ve been pleasantly surprised at how few times I’ve done it. The logic of the new keybindings is winning.</p>

    </p></div>
    <p>Yesterday, there was <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/recently-created-shortcuts-links-are-currently-broken/">a crisis among iOS automation people</a>, as Apple broke all the <code>icloud.com</code> links to shortcuts. How this happened—or even what happened—has not been explained, but Apple seems to be slowly restoring the links as I write this.</p>
<p>This reminded me of Apple’s bad behavior with online documentation URLs, specifically those for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man pages</a>. For a few years, Apple kept changing where it kept its HTML-formatted man pages, breaking links all over the internet. <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2016/05/man-alive-again/">As I said</a> in a post five years ago, complaining about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… Apple is a terrible citizen of the web. Links, especially to programming documentation, should be maintained. If a directory structure has to be changed, redirects should be used to send visitors to the new locations. This is Web 101.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More recently, Apple has stopped moving its man pages around and just deleted them from the internet entirely. As best I can tell, there is no way to see an online version of any of the man pages that ship with macOS. Unless you want to go straight to the <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/text_cmds/text_cmds-106/sort/sort.1.in"><code>nroff</code> source</a>, which is kind of hard to read.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ss64.com/">SS64 site</a> has what they say are macOS man pages, and they rank high in Google and DuckDuckGo searches, but I find they often don’t match what I get from running <code>man</code> in the Terminal. For example, <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/sort.html">SS64’s <code>sort</code> page</a> doesn’t have a DESCRIPTION section, and its explanations of several options differ from my local man page for <code>sort</code>.</p>
<p>So when I blog about a command, I can’t always link to an accurate man page. Worse, my old posts are littered with broken links, and there’s no longer a way to fix them.</p>

    <p>A few days ago, I mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/drdrang/status/1371158960489779210">on Twitter</a> that <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2021/03/message-setting-tweak/">my last post</a> was the first one I’ve written on and published from a Mac in over three years.<sup id="fnref:post"><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fn:post" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I had switched to blogging from an iPad through a combination of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471#?platform=ipad">Drafts</a> and Shortcuts for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was trying to learn the best ways to use an iPad, and forcing myself to use it for blogging seemed like a good way to learn.</li>
<li>My older son’s laptop had crapped out on him, and I gave him my MacBook Air as a stopgap until we got him a new computer.</li>
<li>I was wondering if I’d ever use a Mac notebook again, as Apple was in the middle of a five-year period in which it seemed determined to ruin its most popular line of computers.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m going to write soon about how and why I decided to move back to the Mac for most of my work (the M1 is a big part of the story, of course, but not the whole story), but for now I want to go over how I’ve organized the tools I use for writing and publishing this blog from a Mac.</p>
<p>It starts with <a href="https://www.barebones.com/">BBEdit</a>, the <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/03/19/proxyman">Mac-assed</a> text editor that has lots of great editing tools built in and, at least as important, allows you to build your own tools to extend it. Back when I was blogging regularly from BBEdit, I had written several scripts to make blogging easier. Over the past couple of weeks, I resurrected those scripts and added to them, stealing several ideas I used in Drafts and Shortcuts.</p>
<p>What I have now is a new and improved Blogging <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/08/helper-scripts-in-bbedit-packages/">package</a> that combines scripts written in Bash, Python, Perl, and AppleScript. The AppleScripts are all accessible from the Scripts menu (the one that looks like a scroll).</p>
<p><img alt="Blogging Scripts" class="ss" src="http://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210316-Blogging%20Scripts.png" title="Blogging Scripts" width="95%" /></p>
<p>These all add text to the document I’m working on.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="menu">Safari Front Link</span> turns the currently selected text into a Markdown link to Safari’s frontmost web page. It doesn’t activate Safari or force me to copy the URL—all the Safari work happens in the background.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Old Link</span> turns the currently selected text into a Markdown link to a web page that I’ve already linked to. It presents a list of all the links in the current document and asks me to choose one. I should change the name of this one to <span class="menu">Choose Old Link</span>.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Safari Choose Link</span> turns the currently selected test into a Markdown link to one of the tabs in Safari. It presents a list of all the Safari tabs and asks me to choose one. This should be called <span class="menu">Choose Safari Link</span>.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Footnote</span> inserts a Markdown footnote at the current cursor position and repositions the cursor for me to write the footnote text.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Source of Front Page</span> assumes the frontmost page in Safari is a page here on ANIAT. It goes to the server, grabs the Markdown source of that page, and opens a new BBEdit document with that text in it. This is mainly for when readers find an error in a post that I have to correct.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Source of Last Post</span> is similar to <span class="menu">Source of Front Page</span>, but doesn’t use Safari. It pulls out the Markdown source of my most recent post.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Image Tag from Clipboard</span> inserts an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag at the cursor position, filling in the <code>src</code>, <code>alt</code>, and <code>title</code> attributes from the clipboard.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Table from Numbers</span> gets the contents of the frontmost Numbers spreadsheet, converts it into a Markdown table, and inserts it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the scripts in the Blogging package are Text Filters. These are shell, Python, or Perl scripts that work on either the selected text or the entire document.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="menu">Line Number Code</span> does pretty much what you’d expect. When I paste a script into a blog post, it numbers the lines and formats them.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Tabs to Markdown Table</span> takes selected text that I’ve copied and pasted from a spreadsheet and formats it as a Markdown table.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Normalize Table</span> adds spaces to <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2014/06/cleaning-up-my-markdown-table-cleanup-script/">clean up a messy Markdown table</a>.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Update Header</span> cleans up the post’s metadata, which is in the top 4–5 lines of the document.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Preview Post</span> opens a local preview in Safari so I can see how the post will look when it’s published.</li>
<li><span class="menu">Publish Post</span> does what you think.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the things I don’t like about BBEdit’s package system is that scripts and text filters from the same package don’t appear together. Scripts are in the scripts menu (or palette), and text filters are in the <span class="menu">Text▸Apply Text Filter</span> menu (or palette). But <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> can handle that.</p>
<p>I created a Blogging macro group in Keyboard Maestro, with simple macros that select the various menu items from the Blogging package. The macros in this group appear in a <a href="https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/manual/Palettes">KM palette</a> whose appearance is toggled by ⌃⌥⌘B.</p>
<p><img alt="Blogging Palette" class="ss" src="http://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210316-Blogging%20Palette.png" title="Blogging Palette" width="30%" /></p>
<p>The items in the palette are grouped by function.</p>
<p>As I said, some of the scripts behind these commands are <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2012/08/more-markdown-reference-links-in-bbedit/">old ones</a> that I just haven’t used in a while. Some have been rewritten in the past couple of weeks to make them cleaner or add feature. Some are brand new to account for the changes I made a couple of years ago to the blog’s internal organization. Many of the scripts, I think, would be of no use to anyone but me. I’ll write about those that may be more broadly useful after I’ve lived with them for a while and shaken out the bugs.</p>

      • And now it’s all this
      
        • by Dr. Drang
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>When I got my new MacBook Air a few weeks ago, I decided to start it from scratch rather than have it migrate from my iMac. This isn’t as much work as it used to be, as most of the files I wanted on the new machine would come over through Dropbox and iCloud Drive. And most of the settings would transfer when I signed into iCloud. It all worked pretty much as expected, but there have been a few stragglers.</p>
<p>This morning I was using the Air to assemble my 2020 tax information and had to sign in to brokerages and banks to download statements and other documents. Because I’d never used the Air with these accounts before, they texted me security codes that I would then enter to confirm (more or less) that I was who I said I was.</p>
<p>This process has improved a lot over the years. It used to be that I’d get the texts on my phone and then type the code into my Mac. Later, I was able to copy the code from my iPhone, and it would be transferred automatically to my Mac’s clipboard, and I could paste it in. Finally, I got things set up so my Mac got the text directly, and when I clicked in the security code field, it would offer to enter the code itself. No need to select and copy it out of the text message.</p>
<p>That’s what I expected to happen this morning, but it didn’t. The texts came to my phone but not to the Air. I looked through the settings in Messages on the Air, hoping to find the solution, but nothing looked right (Enable Messages in iCloud was already turned on).</p>
<p>The answer, as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/05/07/how-to-get-text-messages-on-your-mac/">9to5Mac</a> told me, was on my phone. I metaphorically smacked myself on the head. Of course. Only the phone can receive regular SMS messages, so only it can initiate the transfer of those messages to a Mac. I opened    Settings&gt;Messages&gt;Text Message Forwarding and flipped the switch to enable the Air.</p>
<p><img alt="Message forwarding settings" class="ss" src="http://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210314-Message%20forwarding%20settings.jpg" title="Message forwarding settings" width="60%" /></p>
<p>It’s possible I have too many devices now.</p>
<p>It’ll probably be a while before I stop running into these little tweaks that need doing. I’m kind of surprised at how few I’ve hit after the first week. iCloud really has improved tremendously over the years.</p>
<p>I don’t get many regular (i.e., non-iMessage) texts these days, so I was wondering how long it would be before I could be sure my setting change had worked. As I was writing this post, a spam text came in on the Air. Success! Sort of.</p>

    <p>I’m afraid this will be another Apple complaint post, so you might want to skip over it if you’re tired of them. I do have some positive things to say, especially about my M1 MacBook Air, but first I need to deal with at least some of my backlog of gripes.</p>
<p>Peter Lewis, the man behind <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>, tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/peternlewis/status/1369112164774993923">this</a> a few days ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How exactly do I explain to someone that in Big Sur menus, command keys that are dimmed out in menus are not disabled, despite being drawn in exactly the same grey as menu items that are dimmed out and disabled? What lunatic decided this was a good idea?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Peter Lewis tweet image" class="ss" src="http://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210312-Peter%20Lewis%20tweet%20image.png" title="Peter Lewis tweet image" width="75%" /></p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The M1 MacBook Air is the only machine I have running Big Sur, and for the first few days I kept wondering why certain commands were disabled. They weren’t—I was confused about their status because the gray keyboard shortcut was catching my eye and the black command name wasn’t. It wasn’t until I slowed down and looked at the menus carefully that I noticed the contradictory text coloring.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Macs since 1985, and gray text in a menu item has <em>always</em> meant “disabled.” This was true even though early Macs didn’t have true gray.<sup id="fnref:gray"><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fn:gray" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Among Mac users, “grayed out” is a synonym for “disabled” and has been for ages. Now, because looking cool is taking precedence over clear communication, we have menu items that tell us the command is available but the keyboard shortcut isn’t.</p>
<p>If Big Sur had chosen some new method to tell the user that a command was disabled, then maybe using gray text for the keyboard shortcut would be defensible. But as Peter says, it still uses gray—the exact same shade of gray—for disabled items.</p>
<p>In some ways, this is worse than confusing. It’s an indication that Big Sur considers keyboard shortcuts less important than using the menu. By making the shortcuts less prominent, they are less likely to be noticed and will therefore take longer to learn. As a result, Mac users will be less efficient.</p>
<p>The traditional knock on Apple is that it cares more about how things look than how they work. This argument is put forward by idiots who don’t understand that in user interfaces, how things look affects how they work. Apple’s best interfaces weren’t simply eye candy; they drew you in by being attractive, but they were also easy to use and easy to learn from. The way they looked made you a better, more effective computer user. Is that still the case?</p>
<p>When I first noticed the gray shortcuts, I <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/big-sur-menu-shortcuts-in-gray-fixable/22107">raised the issue</a> in the Mac Power Users forum<sup id="fnref:power"><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fn:power" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to see if anyone knew of a way to get back the old look. I was hoping there might be some <code>defaults write</code> command that would revert to black text. But apparently there is no solution.<sup id="fnref:reduce"><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fn:reduce" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I know that complaining about how things were better in the past is a laughable characteristic of the elderly, but god damn it, this <em>was</em> better before. Yes, I can still learn new keyboard shortcuts by slowing down and peering carefully to read the gray-on-gray text. But why should I have to?</p>
<p>The problem is certainly not that Apple tries out new interface ideas. The problem is that the bad new ideas stick around. When menus became translucent, I thought it was a fad designed to show off the power of their graphics engine. Surely, I thought, Apple will recognize that they add nothing to usability and are, if anything, a visual distraction to readability. But here we are, years later, and Apple is still selling computers with blurry messes in their menu backgrounds.</p>
<p>Thanks to Accessibility settings, <em>I</em> don’t have translucent menus on my Macs. One of the first things I did with my new M1 MacBook Air was dig into Settings and turn on “Reduce transparency.” If only Apple thought gray keyboard shortcuts were a problem for low vision users.</p>

    <p>Last Saturday, I found myself in the unusual position of praising Apple <a href="https://twitter.com/drdrang/status/1368205380954845186">on Twitter</a>. I was updating my new M1 MacBook Air to macOS 11.2.2, and I found the “time remaining” estimate to be surprisingly accurate.</p>
<p><img alt="OS update progress screen" class="ss" src="http://leancrew.com/all-this/images2021/20210310-OS%20update%20progress%20screen.jpg" title="OS update progress screen" width="80%" /></p>
<p>Not just near the end, when I took the photo, but right from the beginning and throughout the process, the countdown matched what really happened. As someone whose Apple-related tweets tend toward criticism and snark, I thought it was worth commenting when Apple fixed something that was a longstanding subject of ridicule.</p>
<p>The honeymoon didn’t last long. <a href="https://twitter.com/drdrang/status/1368643210759839750">The next day</a>, while trying to take a screenshot with <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2021/02/snapclip-homebrew-and-sysctl/">SnapClip</a>, I got an error message about the system being unable to find <a href="https://manpagez.com/man/1/xcrun/"><code>xcrun</code></a>, which is part of macOS’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/">Command Line Tools</a>. After a little googling on the text of the error message and some exploration in the Finder, I learned that the OS update had deleted the entire</p>
<pre><code>/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
</code></pre>
<p>directory, where <code>xcrun</code> lives.<sup id="fnref:xcrun"><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fn:xcrun" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Fixing the problem wasn’t hard; I just ran</p>
<pre><code>xcode-select --install
</code></pre>
<p>and a few minutes later everything was back to normal.</p>
<p>When I learned yesterday that 11.2.3 had been released, I decided to update right away. Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted to know whether Apple had fixed things or whether this update would also destroy the Command Line Tools installation.</li>
<li>If it was the latter, I wanted to do the update while I still remembered how to repair the damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Immediately after updating, I tried to run SnapClip and got the same <code>xcrun</code> error. I looked in</p>
<pre><code>/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr
</code></pre>
<p>and found that its <code>bin</code> subdirectory—as well as several others—was gone. Annoying, but at least I had the fix at my fingertips.</p>
<p><a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2011/07/python-problems-on-lion-mostly-self-inflicted/">Many years ago</a>, OS updates would sometimes overwrite the Python <code>site-packages</code> directory in the <code>/Library/Python</code> tree. This was pretty bad behavior, as the whole point of the <code>site-packages</code> directory is to hold modules that the user installed. But I think destroying Command Line Tools is even worse because Apple is overwriting directories installed <em>by its own software</em>. And how has this gotten past Apple’s developers? Surely they have Command Line Tools installed on their machines.</p>
<p>In one sense Apple’s “time remaining” estimate is still wrong because it doesn’t account for the time I have to spend reinstalling what it destroyed.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:xcrun">
<p>I freely confess that I don’t understand why <code>xcrun</code> is necessary to run SnapClip. As far as I know, it isn’t called by any of SnapClip’s components, and its <a href="https://manpagez.com/man/1/xcrun/">man page</a> doesn’t indicate to me why it would be necessary. But my ignorance doesn’t change the fact that it <em>is</em> necessary. <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/#fnref:xcrun" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

      • Andy Ihnatko's Celestial Waste of Bandwidth
      
        • by Ihnatko
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>&#8220;I smell smoke&#8221; is the worst First Thought Upon Waking. Close behind it (for me, at least) is &#8220;I recall having a Clever Idea at about 2 AM last night&#8230;and that I implemented it right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>When that&#8217;s Thought #1, Thought #2 is &#8220;What the hell sort of disaster awaits me&#8221; and then &#8220;None of this becomes real if I stay in bed.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s now noon the next day and (well I&#8217;ll be damned) the Good Idea I had at 2 AM last night continues to seem like a good idea, even after a solid nine hours of sleep and a light breakfast. That&#8217;s highly unusual for <em>any</em> 2 AM Idea of mine. <em>This</em> one was about fixing this blog&#8217;s backend. I&#8217;ve had <em>loads</em> of ideas on that at all hours of the day and night for<em> years.</em> None of them have ever paid off. Can you blame me for being skeptical?</p>



<p>Y&#8217;see, my dream goal has always been for the machinery of the site to be as good as <a href="https://amzn.to/2SVyGny">&#8220;Catwoman&#8221; as written and drawn by Darwyn Cooke</a>. My <em>realistic</em> goal is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWrOmEtXk0k">&#8220;Catwoman&#8221; as portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer in &#8220;Batman Returns.&#8221;</a> But the outcome has always been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6pJbjbRnAA">the 2004 &#8220;Catwoman&#8217; film with Halle Berry and Sharon Stone.</a></p>



<p>I thought I&#8217;d elaborate on it, for your and for Future Andy&#8217;s edification.</p>



<p>The problem was that I couldn&#8217;t get the site&#8217;s design or features dialed in just right. Its appearance alone was eating up almost all of the problem-solving energy I&#8217;d allocated for my blog. A WordPress site&#8217;s appearance is defined by its Theme, which is a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, and other kinds of code. When I coded everything up myself, the blog looked right but lacked the muscular resilience that every modern blog needs (such as supporting any combination of device and browser). When I used a third-party theme, the blog was fully responsive to all kinds of screens but customizing the theme to my tastes and needs was like walking on red-hot Lego bricks in bare feet.</p>



<p>(And when I say &#8220;customizing&#8221; I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;Applying a signature aesthetic and identity.&#8221; I mean simply &#8220;getting rid of the things I absolutely despise.&#8221; Despise, and ultimately even <em>resent</em>. Even when it was part of an incredible WordPress framework that I&#8217;d paid $100 for, no amount of my work or customer support&#8217;s customer support could remove the empty white box under the title of a post, which is where the theme desperately wanted to put an author avatar.)</p>



<p>Consequently, I wasn&#8217;t posting here <em>at all.</em> I used to blog regularly! I loved it! But the blog had become like an old car that <em>just barely</em> can pass its state inspection. This is another subject of which I am quite familiar. Driving the car isn&#8217;t fun because your mind comes to associate &#8220;being in the car&#8221; with &#8220;being stranded by the side of the road, waiting for the engine to cool down enough that you can temporarily seal a coolant leak with silicone tape.&#8221; I still had ideas for blog posts on a regular basis. But I could count on getting distracted or discouraged along the way by thinking about the site&#8217;s engine.</p>



<p>Yesterday I had a critical moment of clarity. It came in the form of a piece of life wisdom that&#8217;s gotten me through many, <em>many</em> challenges in every conceivable area of life:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>&#8220;Take a step back and ask &#8216;What is my actual </strong><em><strong>goal</strong></em> <strong>here? How would I define a Win?&#8221;</strong></p><cite>– Me, writing to myself.</cite></blockquote>



<p>How many times have you been at an airport and witnessed somebody (who, admittedly, is having a bad day and is not at his or her best) getting <em>super</em> into an argument with an attendant at the check-in counter? They&#8217;re wasting all of their emotional and intellectual resources on trying to win the argument. But that&#8217;s not why they went to the airport, is it? Their <em>goal</em> is to get to Denver in time for the Box Apricot Juice Festival.</p>



<p>Once I realigned myself and reaffirmed that my Goal was just to self-publish stuff to a blog that looked good and was accessible to as many people as possible, I could erase about thirty stubborn problems from the project whiteboard. They were no longer relevant.</p>



<p>Every time WordPress releases a major upgrade to the platform, they release a new, up-to-date default theme named after the year of release. I had been on &#8220;Twenty Nineteen.&#8221; This new theme showed off WordPress&#8217; new prowess at modular page design. I replaced it with Twenty Seventeen. Then Twenty Sixteen. I kept going backwards like that until the live preview showed me a version of this blog that mostly looked like I wanted it to look, and had <em>nothing</em> that I hated or even &#8220;thought I could get used to&#8221; or &#8220;could probably fix by creating a daughter theme based on the parent.&#8221;</p>



<p>(&#8220;Twenty Twelve.&#8221; Oh, by the way: themes are indeed huge collections of code, not just design layouts. It&#8217;s important to note that although Twenty Twelve&#8217;s <em>appearance</em> hasn&#8217;t changed since the first &#8220;Avengers&#8221; movie had its first release, its <em>code</em> has been updated and modernized regularly.)</p>



<p>Next, I deleted every WordPress plugin that wasn&#8217;t absolutely required for running a basic blog. My server was littered with active and deactivated plugins, like rusted and busted tanks and cannon on a field of battle where the fighting never ends. I&#8217;d installed many of them after a (cringe) 2 AM Good Idea. A third-party theme refused to let me change the spacing between paragraphs via changes to CSS, <em>but</em> this plugin I found on Github says it can override anything&#8230;really? OMG that would be <em>awesome</em> if it worked&#8230;</p>



<p>I even deleted a default menu that had been in place since nearly the beginning. It took me ten minutes to replace it with a simple bar of links to my podcasts and online presences.</p>



<p>The only thing I kept (apart from my decade-old WordPress database of blog posts) was the masthead. I should scale it down. Eventually.</p>



<p>After going on a half-hour-long Marie Kondo/Incredible Hulk mashup-style rampage of deletion and destruction, I was left with a nice blog that lets me focus on creating, not fixing or administrating.</p>



<p>Huh.</p>



<p>I wish I hadn&#8217;t wasted ten years of effort, but we can only walk from where we stand. I&#8217;m happy that I can finally put this one in the Win column.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll close with some Tech Columnist-style big-picture beard-stroking.</p>



<p>(Fetches a humidor from a shelf above his desk. Removes a strap-on beard that he bought for exactly this purpose. Straps it on, adjusts it with little care.)</p>



<p>The fact that I&#8217;ve been blogging &#8220;since before there was a word for it,&#8221; as I like to say, was one of my biggest handicaps in this process. I published my earliest blog posts by hand-coding HTML files. When I caught the fever, I wrote a fairly sophisticated client-side blogging and publishing app all by myself. Sure, I was aware that the technology behind a website in 1998 and one in 2019 is as different as starting a fire by banging two rocks together and doing it by just forgetting to send your Galaxy Note 7 back to Samsung after the recall notice. </p>



<p>But I still saw Ihnatko.com as a server directory where code and content files lived. I understood code and content. I&#8217;d knew I&#8217;d have to learn some new stuff (like PHP), but it seemed like the core concept was the same.</p>



<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong. A modern website is too complicated an organism to be raised and bred by a lone amateur. No matter <em>how</em> geeky. The education and experience of a professional web developer is required.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<ul><li><strong>As always, the value of a professional is most apparent in a chaotic situation, not a routine one.</strong> And chaos is the cartilege that holds a website together. I learned how CSS styles are <em>supposed</em> to work. But learning how CSS works in actual practice requires years of daily experience (and drinking regularly with a community of fellow web developers).</li><li><strong>The code that makes a website run is too complicated for anybody to understand how it all works together as a unit. </strong>I believe that even the pros categorize each of a site&#8217;s code elements as either &#8220;something I completely understand&#8221; (usually: something they wrote themselves), &#8220;something I don&#8217;t understand, but I trust it because even when it fails it does so in a predictable way,&#8221; and &#8220;something I <em>don&#8217;t</em> understand and <em>don&#8217;t</em> trust at all, but the site can&#8217;t function without it.&#8221; It&#8217;s almost impossible to trace the movement of a bug throughout the entire ecosystem of code. At the very least, it isn&#8217;t the most practical solution. So things get patched instead of fixed, amping up the chaos further.</li><li>I<strong>n 2019, a website has to do way, </strong><em><strong>wayyyyyyy</strong></em><strong> more than just serve content.</strong><em> </em>It&#8217;s an app platform, even if the only app I choose to run is the one that displays the 742 words I just wrote about why nectarines should be a different color. At a minimum, I still need to worry about Bad People trying to exploit my WordPress install for selfish purposes that have nothing to do with fresh fruit troubleshooting <em>at all.</em> Protecting a server from malicious code that adds it to a botnet, mines bitcoin, or stuffs its database with URLs to game Google Search isn&#8217;t for amateurs. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why I closed commenting.</li><li><strong>Web tech moves so quickly that &#8220;best solutions&#8221; and &#8220;best practices&#8221; are hard to identify.<em> </em></strong>Good luck to you if you aren&#8217;t a working pro, and staying up to date on these things isn&#8217;t part of your daily duties. You&#8217;ll find yourself implementing a workaround from 2016, instead of the Solution that everybody started using in 2018.</li></ul>



<p>As discouraging as all of the above might already seem, keep in mind that I&#8217;m just describing a simple blog. As WordPress and my understanding of its power grew, I began to play with a lot of ambitious ideas. What if instead of setting up a simple continuation of my blog, I went bigger? What if the purpose of Ihnatko.com were to increase my influence and international reknown to that of an Iron Chef?</p>



<p>Okay, you&#8217;re right, that&#8217;s presumptuous and insane. But writing and selling ebooks isn&#8217;t a nutty idea, and if my online presence functions as a marketing tool that creates new opportunities, wouldn&#8217;t that be a good thing?</p>



<p>It sure would! But each of these goals adds complexity, instability, and new maintenance issues.</p>



<p>What I&#8217;m driving at &#8212; no pun intended &#8212; is that the fact that even though I was rather good at repairing my very first car, if I bought a new car today I wouldn&#8217;t <em>dream</em> of trying to fix it myself. My first car was already more than ten years old when it was handed down to me in the mid-Eighties. I knew that it wouldn&#8217;t run without spark, gas, or air and I knew how each one of those things moved throughout the system.</p>



<p>I can let myself get <em>nostalgic</em> for the days when my site ran on a bulletproof Chrysler Slant Six engine. But self-hosting a modern website with high expectations isn&#8217;t realistic. I have to either focus the site on a single goal that I can easily manage on my own, move the site to a service that does all of the management for me, or hire a pro.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m too cheap to hire someone who knows what they&#8217;re doing and I&#8217;m too lazy to move Ihnatko.com to a new host. Thus, my path to victory was clearly marked.</p>

        • by Ihnatko
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Longtime fans of my blog will react to this post with the same excitement as the crowd at a Paul McCartney concert when he sings the first two words of &#8220;Hey, Jude.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to figure out a new scheme for this blog&#8221; is one of Ihnatko.com&#8217;s all-time greatest hits. Oh, sure, I get more excited about performing my newer stuff. But then I see all of you swaying together and singing all of the words and I&#8217;m right there with you.</p>



<p>If you were dragged here by a life partner or a school friend, here&#8217;s some background. I launched this blog in the Nineties (before &#8220;blog&#8221; was even a word, and <em>long</em> before there was software for publishing one. So I wrote my own. Eventually, WordPress came into being. I switched to WordPress in about 2005. By 2006, the blog looked and worked about 90% like how I dreamed. I&#8217;ve been working on it ever since. I think it&#8217;s now at, like, 92%.</p>



<p>I could be wrong. The CSS style selector for that number keeps rendering it in white on a white background, 744 pixels outside of the window&#8217;s visible canvas area. I&#8217;ve no idea why and every time I think I&#8217;ve figured out how to target the style correctly in the site&#8217;s WordPress theme, another style sheet somewhere else overrides my changes.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t regret moving to WordPress, of course! My own code ran the site just fine throughout the Clinton administration but by the Bush era I needed something better. And I sure know a lot more about servers and webapps and security than I ever would have if I were just studying that stuff academically instead of getting my hands greasy.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just that I sure haven&#8217;t been doing very much actual <em>posting</em> in the past few years. Don&#8217;t blame WordPress. Blame me for wanting my site to look and function the way I wanted it to. And then maybe blame WordPress for making that so bloody difficult. There&#8217;s still room on the Blame Bus for the publishing industry, which doesn&#8217;t pay me nearly enough to just throw a couple of bricks of simoleons at actual web developers and designers who could do the job <em>for</em> me.</p>



<p>Lord knows I&#8217;ve kept trying. I&#8217;ve had lots of Great Ideas of how a certain new framework or a specific set of plugins might <em>please dear God</em> put an end to the journey.</p>



<p>Well! Good news, everyone: I had a whole new idea on how to approach the problem!</p>



<p>It&#8217;s simple and elegant. Like the long-sought proof for computer science&#8217;s &#8220;sensitivity&#8221; conjecture, it can even be expressed in the space of a single Tweet:</p>



<p>&#8220;Andy pretty much gives up on his ambitions and settles for just having a blog again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yeah. I really want to blog regularly again. So I&#8217;ve metaphorically ripped out the section of my brain that&#8217;s aware of WordPress&#8217; potential. I&#8217;ve also somewhat less than metaphorically ripped out every last plugin that WordPress doesn&#8217;t absolutely require, and downgraded the site&#8217;s theme package to whatever was Stock WordPress in 2012.</p>



<p>Ihnatko.com is now, in function and appearance, not very different from what it was when <em>The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air</em> was still on the air.</p>



<p>But though it&#8217;s lost a lot of style and ambition, the blog now has at least one aspect that I&#8217;ve been unsuccessfully chasing for more than ten years: there&#8217;s nothing about the design that I hate. When I&#8217;m inspired to create a new post, I can write a new post. In the blog&#8217;s previous incarnations, I would open the admin page and my trackpad&#8217;s pointer would find its way to the code editor because GOD DAMN IT if I&#8217;ve told this theme not to attach an author photo why the BLOODY HELL does it still add ten square inches of white space for the spot where the photo would have gone?!? And the idea I had for a blog post is cast to the land of ghosts and winds.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s keep our fingers crossed that the synapses leading to the Caring About Anything But Creating Content centers of my brain remain resolutely cauterized. I&#8217;m optimistic because holy <em>cats</em> does it stink in here.</p>



<p>On to the new stuff. After I open a window.</p>



<p></p>

    <p>Greetings! At some point, you will visit this post and see a rundown of the topics I discussed on Boston Public Radio today, including links to more stuff to read.</p>



<p>This is not that point.</p>



<p>Hey! How about a photo of me and Errol Morris? He was on right after me. You bet your <em>life</em> I stuck around to listen (and yes, he was amazing). I was super-pleased to get a chance to tell him how much I&#8217;ve loved his documentaries. The photo was just a bonus.</p>

<p>I will now enjoy lunch at the Boston Public Library.</p>



<p>But <em>not</em> before handing you a link to Kashmir Hill&#8217;s <em>incredibly good</em> series over at Gizmodo. I hope she gets all the awards for this. Even ones that have nothing to do with journalism or technology.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been a writer for way too many years to put any stock in any sort of &#8220;I just wait for Inspiration to strike me and then it&#8217;s as though I&#8217;m merely a passive conduit for my Muse&#8221; self-pose. That&#8217;s the fantasy of someone who wants to write but never will. In truth, you&#8217;ve got to put your hands on the keyboard and keep pushing the cursor to the right and hope that you wind up with the kind of garbage that can be composted into something valuable, over time.</p>



<p>Which isn&#8217;t to say that you&#8217;re in full control of the process every single time. My version of the former high school jock&#8217;s story about how he once scored four touchdowns in a single game is the day I got a great idea the moment I woke up and had 16,000 words of my next book finished by dawn the next day.</p>



<p>Yes, I was clearly in the zone that day and as soon as I pulled my MacBook off the nightstand and into my lap and sat up, I knew that I was going to be making huge progress on something.</p>



<p>Some days&#8230;</p>



<p>Well, I spent some time &#8212; way too much time &#8212; this morning imagining Disney owning the rights to the Velvet Underground&#8217;s entire catalogue and preparing a tribute show for the theme parks featuring classic Disney characters. I went back and forth a while before deciding that Donald Duck should sing &#8220;Heroin,&#8221; and not Goofy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Then I fixed myself some lunch and realized that Donald Duck was okay, but Daffy Duck is clearly the only correct choice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Heroin&#8221; is all about the tempo&#8217;s slow, patient burn and its eventual disintegration into explosive chaos. Daffy&#8217;s a proven master at this sort of material.</p>



<p>By the time I finished my sandwich and cup of mini-pretzels, I had imagined Elmer Fudd on &#8220;Femme Fatale&#8221; (with Bugs Bunny coming in on the harmonies, in drag) and concluded that I didn&#8217;t want to go forward on this album unless we could move the whole project to Warners.</p>



<p>So the point of this story that a writer&#8217;s daily toil is to pursue an idea with diligence, without any assurances that the labor won&#8217;t further their professional or personal goals. Some days, the process yields a whole five percent of your next book, done and dusted in a single day. On others, you will wind up with a solid idea that you can&#8217;t monetize properly until many, many, valuable bits of intellectual property fall into the public domain.</p>

    <p>Flo and I had a good time recording the first episode of the year. Maybe because it&#8217;s still close to the holidays and there hasn&#8217;t been any really terrible Google news to talk about yet?</p>



<p>Whatever! Yay! No terrible news!</p>



<p>Instead, we&#8217;ve got news about two of Google&#8217;s most interesting works-in-progress: the Fuchsia operating system and those neat little Project Soli radar modules that could enable brilliant new touchless interfaces.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17595968/waymo-self-driving-cars-8-million-miles-testing">Waymo&#8217;s CEO said back in July</a> that Waymo&#8217;s software had driven five billion miles on simulated roads and traffic. Its real cars had driven eight million miles on real roads, for real. There&#8217;s no question that Waymo is way ahead of everyone else in the development of self-driving cars.</p>



<p>And yet if the goal is to make an autonomous driving system that can transport people from doorstep to doorstep via roads that are also open to human drivers and pedestrian, Waymo isn&#8217;t close. Five billion miles in simulation is just table stakes. Engineers can only simulate what they can predict. Human behavior is utterly unpredictable.</p>



<p>I imagine that you&#8217;re expecting me to make a joke about irrational Boston drivers after that line. Oh, sweetie. <em>Honey.</em> No. It&#8217;s true that our moves are mostly dictated by Brownian motion but that&#8217;s not the real problem. To <em>truly</em> gape into the maw of madness, you need to look at our network of roads. Most of them were initially laid out by either cows looking for grazing land or 17th and 18th-century Puritans walking to church. Would you trust either species to design a backyard patio? I don&#8217;t think so. We think about this often, especially when we&#8217;re trying to find a way out of an entire neighborhood whose streets are all one-way and end with &#8220;Right Turns Only&#8221; signs.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not Waymo&#8217;s problem. Not <em>yet.</em> One of the big challenges they&#8217;re confronting during their wide test program in Arizona is how the presence of marked autonomous vehicles changes the behavior of other cars on the road.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/tech/2018/12/11/waymo-self-driving-vehicles-face-harassment-road-rage-phoenix-area/2198220002/">The Arizona Republic</a> has been reporting on open hostility and road rage against Waymo cars:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A Waymo self-driving van cruised through a Chandler neighborhood Aug. 1 when test driver Michael Palos saw something startling as he sat behind the wheel&nbsp;— a bearded man in shorts aiming a handgun at him as he passed the man&#8217;s driveway.<br />The incident is one of at least 21 interactions documented by Chandler police during the past two years where&nbsp;people have harassed the autonomous vehicles and their human test drivers.<br />People have thrown rocks at Waymos. The tire on one was&nbsp;slashed while it was stopped in traffic. The vehicles have&nbsp;been yelled at, chased and one Jeep was responsible for forcing the vans off roads six times.</p></blockquote>



<p>And from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/waymo-self-driving-cars-arizona-attacks.html">The New York Times</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“There are other places they can test,” said Erik O’Polka, 37, who was issued a warning by the police in November after multiple reports that his Jeep Wrangler had tried to run Waymo vans off the road — in one case, driving head-on toward one of the self-driving vehicles until it was forced to come to an abrupt stop.<br />His wife, Elizabeth, 35, admitted in an interview that her husband “finds it entertaining to brake hard” in front of the self-driving vans, and that she herself “may have forced them to pull over” so she could yell at them to get out of their neighborhood. The trouble started, the couple said, when their 10-year-old son was nearly hit by one of the vehicles while he was playing in a nearby cul-de-sac.<br />“They said they need real-world examples, but I don’t want to be their real-world mistake,” said Mr. O’Polka, who runs his own company providing information technology to small businesses.</p></blockquote>



<p>There can be no rational reason to attack any vehicle that&#8217;s carrying people (remember that these Waymo vans are often carrying passengers and there&#8217;s always a safety driver at the wheel). But there are legit safety concerns about sharing the road with these experimental vehicles. A pedestrian was killed by an Uber autonomous test vehicle in March. Investigators eventually learned that the accident occurred because the human being who was placed behind the wheel to oversee the safety of the vehicle was instead overseeing an episode of &#8220;The Voice&#8221; on her personal phone instead.</p>



<p>[Edited: a reader points out the the road was unlit and that the pedestrian was jaywalking; after reviewing the car&#8217;s footage, the chief of police said that the accident was &#8220;unavoidable.&#8221; Was it? We&#8217;ll never know. But we <em>do</em> know that Uber&#8217;s software was downright crude compared to Waymo&#8217;s: it couldn&#8217;t even go a dozen miles without requiring human intervention of some kind. As of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/technology/uber-self-driving-cars-arizona.html">a March article in The New York Times</a>, Waymo&#8217;s software could go 5600 miles before asking for help. Uber&#8217;s system took too long to see the victim, took too long to decide what to do, and then when it finally alerted the human driver, that driver wasn&#8217;t paying attention. The accident <em>might</em> have been unavoidable but it sure sounds like it needn&#8217;t have been fatal and that Uber&#8217;s platform was nowhere <em>near</em> ready for this type of testing.]</p>



<p><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/abekwok/2018/06/22/uber-self-driving-car-death-pins-blame-human-driver/724542002/">But that doesn&#8217;t dismiss concerns about safety</a>. A car that can be equipped with enough sensors to navigate a road and react to what&#8217;s going on can also be equipped with sensors that detect that a safety driver <em>isn&#8217;t actually watching the road</em>. So why was this kind of accident even possible?</p>



<p>The software can also be very, <em>very</em> annoying for other cars. Experimental self-driving cars all drive like student drivers who got their learners&#8217; permits a week ago and are driving the family&#8217;s &#8220;good&#8221; car. We enter a complicated intersection and make the right move instinctively. Self-driving cars stop and think and wait for a situation to become more clear. They make, like, 18-point turns sometimes.</p>



<p>But hey, these are all &#8220;experimental technology&#8221; problems. Put enough miles on the odometer and they&#8217;ll all get solved.</p>



<p> I&#8217;m more interested in the dangers created by human behavior. We&#8217;re all bound together by a mutually-supportive social contract. And somehow, we leave that contract on the other side of the door when we get inside a car.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m walking on the sidewalk and I nearly bump into another pedestrian. Invariably, we <em>both</em> apologize without even thinking about who might have been at fault. Why? Because it&#8217;s impossible not to identify that meatsack as another human being. It triggers all kinds of genetic programming that helps us all get along and not kill each other. Subconsciously, we emphasize (&#8220;hey, these things happen&#8221;). We also understand that yelling or shoving could have consequences.</p>



<p>Whereas when you trip over a curbstone you can yell at it all you want. Curbstones have zero empathy. This means that you can&#8217;t possibly hurt its feelings. It&#8217;s also why they can keep right on tripping people day after day without feeling any remorse.</p>



<p>Drivers who are prone to road rage might understand <em>intellectually</em> that the car that just cut them off (or is merely heeding a &#8220;No Turn On Red&#8221; traffic sign) contains a human being. But emotionally? Naw. It&#8217;s a car. Yell all you want and blow your horn! Maybe even scare &#8217;em! Why not?</p>



<p>I mean, there are even psychos who throw big rocks off of highway overpasses. Yet dropping big rocks onto busy <em>pedestrian</em> thoroughfares doesn&#8217;t seem to be a widespread thing. Those with plenty of faith in humanity would say that it&#8217;s because identifying with the potential victims is unavoidable. The cynics would say that <em>getting</em> identified would be unavoidable. Either way, people don&#8217;t do it.</p>



<p>So I wonder. Will road-ragers be even angrier and more aggressive against driverless vehicles? Brake-checking a Waymo or even forcing one off the road might seem like kicking a Coke machine, despite the obvious consequences for other people.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t relate to that kind of thinking. Even when I owned a car, I never felt any road rage. How about a different form of this same question: can a drive be expected to show a driverless car the same courtesy as one piloted by a human? </p>



<p>Again, it&#8217;s a question of empathy. I know how much it <em>suuuucks</em> when your exit is coming up and you&#8217;ve been signaling your lane change for a mile and <em>nobody</em> is letting you in. Would a Waymo car push that same &#8220;Be Kind&#8221; button in my head? I dunno.</p>



<p>As always, we can&#8217;t predict how a new technology is going to shape society and human behavior until it&#8217;s out there. For example, I&#8217;m gradually getting used to sending this kind of text to a friend</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">My ETA at the restaurant is<br />6:30. I can't WAIT to see<br />you! I've missed you so much<br />since you moved.</pre>



<p>And getting this back</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Yup</pre>



<p>I can now interpret this as &#8220;The response was curt because s/he read this on a smartwatch. &#8216;Yup&#8217; was one of the two or three canned replies the watch offered to send.&#8221; Whereas I once might have interpreted it as &#8220;Andy, you&#8217;re one of the reasons <em>why</em> I moved away. I only accepted your dinner invitation so I can see the look on your face when I explain it to you without omitting a single detail.&#8221;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get back to Waymo&#8217;s problem.</p>



<p>Self-driving car technology will need to deal with the problems caused by human road rage against driverless vehicles. Naturally, I have a brilliant solution:</p>



<p><em>Goons.</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;ll explain. When a fight breaks out during a pro hockey game, it&#8217;s not usually a case of two random players losing their tempers and throwing down. No. <em>Some</em> players are recruited into the NHL from the minors because they&#8217;re great <em>enforcers</em>, not because they&#8217;re great players.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ice Guardians&#8221; is a fine documentary about the history and role of hockey enforcers. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80150246">It&#8217;s on Netflix</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The Enforcer (&#8220;goon&#8221; is impolite) is part of the game. Today&#8217;s players are so well armored that it&#8217;s tactically worthwhile for a defenseman to take a fifteen minute penalty if it means removing the league&#8217;s high-scorer from the game entirely. The math on this choice changes radically if that same defenseman knows that the opposing team&#8217;s roster <em>also</em> includes the league&#8217;s most efficient enforcer. A fighter who reputably once punished a player so severely that it changed his eye color permanently and they had to go to the DMV to have a new driver&#8217;s license issued.</p>



<p>Waymo&#8217;s fleet should contain Goon Cars. These cars are never occupied by human beings and they&#8217;re painted in a livery that&#8217;s impossible to overlook or to mistake for anything else. My suggestion: a checkerboard paint scheme incorporating alternating colors of &#8220;spray-on body primer&#8221; and &#8220;engine coolant pooled on asphalt.&#8221;</p>



<p>If a Waymo car is getting roughed up out there, it&#8217;ll transmit the offending car&#8217;s license plate and visual indentifiers to the network. The nearest Waymo Goon Car will plot an intercept course, pull up alongside, and administer a Corrective Action to the car&#8217;s bodywork. Even days later, if necessary, relying on APB reports sent out to other Waymo cars&#8217; software.</p>



<p>The Goon Cars won&#8217;t receive the usual top layer of gloss coat. An Impala carrying the paint smears of a Waymo Goon&#8217;s signature colors will continue to caution other drivers long after the actual incident, just as the panic scent of an actual impala being torn apart by leopards warns the rest of the pack to maybe…you know, just chill.</p>



<p>It sounds like an extreme response, but really, once these Waymo Goon Cars have established their reputation, the highways will be safer for everybody. </p>



<p>The mere presence of Tony Twist or Damian Strohmeyer on the ice encouraged a more civilized level of gameplay. Similarly, the sight of a Waymo van with its front-mounted bully-bar, completely blacked-out windows, and signature checkerboard paint scheme (alternating the colors of spray-on body primer and engine coolant puddling on asphalt) will prompt every driver to ask themselves an important question:</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I <em>could.</em> But are the consequences worth it?&#8221;</p>



<p>In return for this innovation, I expect nothing but a reasonable per-vehicle licensing fee and the plaudits of a grateful nation.</p>

      • Andy Ihnatko's Celestial Waste of Bandwidth
      
        • by Ihnatko
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>Someday, you&#8217;re going to spot on online deal for an external drive at a time when you happen to be flush with cash and with no financial perils on the horizon. You should buy that drive. When it arrives, stick it in a closet. Don&#8217;t even open the box.</p>



<p>Why? Because having a fresh, empty drive empowers <em>so many solutions</em> to PC problems. </p>



<p>As I write this, I&#8217;m helping a friend recover from a dramatic interlude between her MacBook Pro and a mug of hot water with lemon. The laptop is, well…donezo. But! She has a Time Machine backup. I erased a 500 gig external SSD, installed a fresh OS onto it, and am performing a restore. It&#8217;ll be a few days before she can get her lemon-soaked MacBook diagnosed but she&#8217;ll be back to work long before then. Her old MacBook Air&#8217;s internal drive is way too small so she&#8217;ll use my SSD as a boot disk.</p>



<p>This is the same SSD that saved my bacon when my own MacBook Pro&#8217;s SSD died a month or two ago. If I hadn&#8217;t had an uninitialized drive standing by, getting it back up and running would have been a nonlinear process involving a nonzero amount of angst. </p>



<p>My goals were to get my main productivity machine back up and running ASAP in the short term, and to fix the hardware in the longterm. Normally, I would have had two options:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Option 1</strong>: Order a new external drive. I&#8217;d have been without a working Mac for a couple of days. And spending a couple of hundred bucks to build a bootable external drive from my backup wouldn&#8217;t have been attractive, given that I was already going to be on the hook for X dollars to replace my Mac&#8217;s faulty component.</li><li><strong>Option 2</strong>: Skip the stopgap solution and replace the internal SSD straight away. This would have been the obvious answer if this were any <em>other</em> $2000 laptop. Alas, I am blessed with an Apple product. This blessing is accompanied by the unavailability of standard upgrade and replacement components. I&#8217;m lucky that my 2015 MacBook Pro was the last model in the line where the SSD is even swappable. Still, I needed some time to do a little research and figure out the right solution.</li></ul>



<p>But I had a fresh, empty 500 gigabyte Samsung SSD standing by. I did a restore and was back up and running after only an hour or two of downtime. I took my sweet time investigating the fix for my MacBook and not only found exactly the right answer, but also a replacement SSD that was 30% off during a one-day sale.</p>



<p>This advice isn&#8217;t complicated, is it?</p>



<p>If you have a huge drive with nothing on it just standing by like a fire extinguisher or a manila envelope with $5000 in cash and three different sets of identity cards, you&#8217;ve got a solution to any number of problems. I was about to list a few but trust me: you&#8217;ll know them when you see them. </p>



<p>Oh, and <strong>BACK UP YOUR DAMN DRIVE</strong>. Both my friend and I went through our trials with our respective elan relatively intact because in the worst-case scenario, we were only losing a little time and money. If we didn&#8217;t have backups, our most productive avenue would have been to try to get Superman to fly circles around the Earth so fast that it spins in the opposite direction and we can go back to the day when our MacBooks were still healthy.</p>



<p>He would have done it &#8212; because he&#8217;s Superman &#8212; but he would have scolded you with the same admonition about backups that I just gave you. Better to learn it now and not owe Superman a favor.</p>

    <p>Happy New Year to all. Take some time to make a list of every good, healthy, positive, and/or admirable thing you did today. And then take some time to reflect on the fact that you&#8217;ve maintained an unbroken streak of doing <em>all</em> of those things <em>every&nbsp;day&nbsp;all&nbsp;year&nbsp;so&nbsp;far.</em> Good for you!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve posted to my blog every day this year!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve taken and posted a photo every day!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve washed a dish!</p>



<p>But I haven&#8217;t shaved yet. I&#8217;ve given it some thought and concluded that doing so would set up some unreasonable expectations for Wednesday.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/">Today is Comicraft&#8217;s annual New Year&#8217;s Day Font Sale</a>. It&#8217;s not accurately named. As usual, they cut the price of each of their fonts down (to $20.19) early last night, and if they keep to form, the sale will continue well into January 2.</p>



<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean you should dilly-dally! If you put it off and miss it, that&#8217;ll be a damned shame for you and for anybody who sees your presentations or labels or business cards or your passive-aggressive signs in the office common breakroom about &#8220;the <em>right</em> way&#8221; to put the carafe back on the coffee maker.</p>



<p>Tips:</p>



<ul><li>Check to see if the font you&#8217;re about to buy has both upper- and lower-case letters. Some are upper-case only. They&#8217;re still fab, but the font might not suit your purpose.</li><li>Also check to see if a font comes in several thicknesses and not just Bold and Italic. These are <em>hugely</em> useful, particularly when you combine several thicknesses on one page.</li><li>Each of these fonts is the same price. You might as well buy the &#8220;International&#8221; version (with bonus characters &amp; symbols), which usually costs ten bucks more.</li><li>Don&#8217;t use the &#8220;guest&#8221; mode when checking out and paying. If you create an account, you can re-download any of your purchases at any time. Last night I looked for Comicraft fonts that were missing from my MacBook and retrieved ones that I&#8217;d bought almost ten years ago.</li></ul>



<p>Which fonts should you start with?</p>



<p>Beats me. I mean, why are you buying these things? The Comicraft sale pays off most bigly when you&#8217;ve identified a specific need. I bought one or two this year with a website redesign and a new business card in mind, for instance.</p>



<p>If this is your first crack at a font catalogue &#8212; specifically this one &#8212; some broad categories might help you find useful stuff:</p>



<ul><li>Comicraft made its reputation on its professional handlettered-style comic book fonts. It seems a shame not to add one to your library. <a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Comicrazy-p/bl001.htm">Comicrazy</a> is my favorite, but they&#8217;ve got loads of styles and each one has its unique strength. <a class="" href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Monologous-International-p/bl033i.htm">Monologous</a> emulates the lettering of classic comics from the Sixties through the Eighties. And yes, I&#8217;ve spent way more time writing new and frequently inappropriate dialogue for old Fantastic Four comics than I care to admit.</li><li>Get a font explicitly for making signs. <a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Sign-Language-International-p/bl041i.htm">Sign Language</a> is an obvious pick. <a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Dash-Decent-International-p/cl340i.htm">Dash Decent</a> is one of the all-stars in my Fonts menu. It&#8217;s my go-to when I need a sign for a bulletin board or a label for a utility drawer.</li><li>Get a font for that kind of lettering that just plain can&#8217;t be faked. When you want dramatic, swoopy letters, you need either <a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Spills-International-p/dl205i.htm">Spills</a> or you need to come up with another idea. Invitations for a Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings or Game Of Thrones-themed party require <a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Spellcaster-p/cl320.htm">Spellcaster</a>. And: your heart was in the right place when you used Helvetica Bold for the sound effect overlays in your kid&#8217;s hockey team&#8217;s season-recap video, but it looked totally lame. For Batman-style text, go straight to <a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Biff-Bam-Boom-p/fx121i.htm">Biff Bam Boom</a>.</li></ul>



<p>But each of these fonts is just twenty dollars (and some change). You can afford to buy fonts just because you <em>like</em> them. It&#8217;s a great opportunity. You&#8217;re going to install these fonts and play with them for a day or two and then forget all about them by January 4. <em>Until</em> you&#8217;re making Halloween goodie bags for a classroom of kids. And <em>then</em> you remember that <a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Altogether-Ooky-p/dl221.htm">Altogether Ooky</a> has been patiently waiting for <em>this&nbsp;exact&nbsp;moment…</em></p>

    </p></div>
    <p>First off, dear WGBH listeners: know that I see my mission as a technology journalist/broadcaster/pundit/lackaduffer as a holy thing. Sir Galahad, when faced with the reality of needing to take an earlier train to make it to the Holy Grail on time, waking up at&nbsp;<em>six thirty,</em>&nbsp;for heaven&#8217;s sake, would have slept straight through the alarm. Or maybe he&#8217;d have shut it off and then gone back to sleep, figuring &#8220;I&#8217;m sure Gawain&#8217;s on top of this.&#8221;</p>



<p>But not Andy Ihnatko. On previous occasions when I exhibited this kind of commitment, people said that Edwin Abbey should have immortalized&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;struggles in a magnificent mural sequence at the Boston Public Library, and not Sir Galahad&#8217;s. They&#8217;re right, of course, but I suppose Abbey&#8217;s hands were tied; he died several decades before my father was born.</p>



<p>Second-off! A shout-out to Edward, the Lyft driver who got me to the train station. His radio was tuned to WGBH when I got in and when he asked me where I was headed from the commuter rail station, he was happy to tell me how much he and his wife enjoyed Boston Public Radio and Margery in particular.</p>



<p>Onward! Here are some links related to my tech segment on today&#8217;s show:</p>



<h4>Comicraft&#8216;s New Year&#8217;s Day Font Sale</h4>



<p>Honest to God, buying new fonts on New Year&#8217;s Day is as big a holiday tradition for me as Patrick Stewart&#8217;s audiobook of &#8220;A Christmas Carol&#8221; and making big plans about making and sending custom Christmas cards but not following through.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/">Comicraft</a></li></ul>



<p>I&#8217;ve got dozens of their fonts on my computers. Here are the three I called out on the show. These, and all other Comicraft fonts, will be marked down to $20.19 for New Year&#8217;s Day:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Comicrazy-p/bl001.htm">Comicrazy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Sign-Language-p/bl041.htm">Sign Language</a></li><li><a href="https://www.comicbookfonts.com/Extra-Extra-p/cl349.htm">Extra Extra</a></li></ul>



<p>&#8220;Comicrazy,&#8221; because not getting a professional, hand-lettered-style comic book font seems like a shame. Comicraft offers plenty of &#8217;em, each with their own unique charm. &#8220;Comicrazy&#8221; is by far the most expensive of them, at $395.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sign Language,&#8221; because it&#8217;s the only answer you need when it&#8217;s time to make a sign or a label or a placard or something. The package includes several thicknesses.</p>



<p>&#8220;Extra Extra,&#8221; to fill the role of &#8220;just a really cool and awesome font.&#8221;</p>



<p>But by all means, hit the site and browse, browse, browse. I&#8217;ve already filled my shopping cart with a few of Comicraft&#8217;s 2018 releases. One of them is earmarked as the masthead font of a new site I&#8217;m building. When January 1 hits,&nbsp; the prices will be automatically updated and I&#8217;ll just click one button.</p>



<h4>Public Domain Day</h4>



<p>What&#8217;s better than getting a $395 font for $20.19? Getting all of the books, movies, music, poetry, paintings, etc. published in 1923 for free!</p>



<p>January 1, 2019 &#8212; the first release of new material into the public domain in over two decades &#8212; has been as eagerly anticipated as The Rapture. Well, surely that&#8217;s an awkward analogy but let&#8217;s just roll with it.</p>



<p>The usual libraries of free public domain content are prepared for this day and will have mountains of new material ready to go the moment it passes into the hands of The People. These are my usual first stops when looking for public-domain content:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a></li><li><a href="https://books.google.com/">Google Books</a></li><li><a href="http://www.openculture.com/">Open Culture</a></li></ul>



<p>Open Culture isn&#8217;t so much a library as it is a blog&nbsp;<em>about</em>&nbsp;public domain and other free media.</p>



<p>And, honestly, any Google search for [<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22public+domain+day%22+1923&amp;rlz=1CAOTWH_enUS820&amp;oq=%22public+domain+day%22+1923&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.7330j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">&#8220;public domain day&#8221; 1923</a>] turns up lots of blog posts of people&#8217;s individual favorites entering the public domain on January 1.</p>



<h3>Apple&#8217;s $29 iPhone Battery Replacement Program Ends December 31</h3>



<p>Phone batteries naturally lose capacity as they get older. If your iPhone is a couple of years old, getting a brand-new Apple-branded battery installed by Apple for $29 is a steal.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the info, on Apple&#8217;s support page:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/battery-power">iPhone Battery Replacement</a></li></ul>



<p>Set up an appointment at your local Apple Store&#8217;s genius bar sooner rather than later.</p>



<h4>The Latest iPads Are Bent, And Apple&#8217;s Fine With That</h4>



<p>Disgraceful. The iPad Pro is a premium product and purchasers shouldn&#8217;t just take Apple&#8217;s word for it that a visible bend won&#8217;t eventually lead to hardware failures.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve bought an iPad Pro in the previous two weeks and there&#8217;s a visible bend, return it for a full refund within Apple&#8217;s standard 14 day return window. If you bought it before that&#8230;well. Just hope for the best. And reflect on the many, many times Apple fans have quoted Steve Jobs&#8217; line about craftsmanship and pride and making sure that even the paint on the side of the fence nobody will see is perfect.</p>



<p>But! Good news if you bought it between November 14th and December 24, you can return your iPad (or anything else you bought from Apple during that period) as late as January 8. My friend Paul has kindly reminded me of Apple&#8217;s annual Holiday return window.</p>

<h4><del>Amazon&#8217;s Alexa Had A Meltdown In Europe On Christmas Day</del> Didn&#8217;t get to it!</h4>



<p>&#8230;Which was embarrassing but not entirely unexpected on a day when hundreds of thousands of people were trying to activate new Echo devices at the same time.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-alexa-issues-christmas-europe-2018-12">Amazon&#8217;s Alexa suffered outages on Christmas Day as people around the world started using their new Echos</a> [Business Insider]</li></ul>



<p>The&nbsp;<em>bigger</em>&nbsp;problem was an iOS app pretending to be Amazon&#8217;s official Alexa setup app. It made it into the App Store&#8217;s list of top ten most-downloaded utilities before Apple took it down:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/27/fake-amazon-alexa-app-psa/">Beware: There’s a fake Amazon Alexa ‘Setup’ app climbing App Store charts</a> [9to5Mac]</li></ul>



<p>The app asked for the Alexa device&#8217;s IP address and serial number. What the app&#8217;s creators are doing with the data they collected is anybody&#8217;s guess but it can&#8217;t be good.</p>



<p>Folks who downloaded &#8220;Setup for Amazon Alexa&#8221; can be forgiven for not noticing that the developer&#8217;s name was &#8220;One World Software&#8221; instead of something Amazon-ey. This is just a reminder that there are stinky people out there and many of them are trying to trick you into downloading their app instead of the one you were looking for. Check for the developer&#8217;s name, the app&#8217;s history, and number of downloads.</p>



<h4>Why Do People Give Up Their Privacy Online? Because They&#8217;ve Become Resigned To It</h4>



<p>Nice piece by&nbsp;Sapna Maheshwari for The New York Times:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://nyti.ms/2RgtGf1">Sharing Data For Deals? More Like Watching It Go With A Sigh </a>[New York Times]</li></ul>



<p>I agree with the central point. People aren&#8217;t giving up their personal data because they don&#8217;t care or they&#8217;re unaware it&#8217;s happening. They&#8217;re doing it for the same reason why we all pay &#8220;convenience charges&#8221; when we buy tickets to shows: we feel like the whole system is stacked against us and it&#8217;s part of this vale of tears known as Life In 2018.</p>



<p>When the Internet and digital services were first rolling out to the launch pad in the Nineties, Congress&#8217; broad attitude was &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, let&#8217;s not interfere with this; we&#8217;ve no idea what we&#8217;re doing as lawmakers and we&#8217;ll probably wind up killing off a huge and important new industry before it even gets started.&#8221;</p>



<p>And that was absolutely the right call. In the Nineties. Now, we&#8217;ve seen what happens when an industry is allowed to operate unregulated, practically. Just as their came a time when the coal industry had to be explicitly told not to hire eight year old children, the time is coming when Facebook, Google, and every digital marketing platform is going to be told that there are going to be some Rules, going forward.</p>



<h4><del>Switching from a Smartphone To a Dumbphone</del> Didn&#8217;t get to it!</h4>



<p>&#8230;A device which the phone industry prefers to refer to as a &#8220;featurephone.&#8221;</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an article about that from The Boston Globe:</p>



<p>Featurephones &#8212; phones that rely on built-in apps instead of an App Store with a huge library &#8212; have suddenly become&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;interesting again. They&#8217;ve always had advantages like extra-long battery life, durability, and a variety of shapes and sizes to fit into even small pockets. Today, we can add &#8220;your kids can get into much less trouble&#8221; and &#8220;no apps mean fewer ways that companies can track you and collect your personal data.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though of course there&#8217;s always going to be a way. Most modern featurephones regard a Facebook app as being about as negotiable a feature as the &#8220;7&#8221; key on the dialing pad.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all. My music while writing this little bagatelle was <a href="https://amzn.to/2QX0oTm">this recording of &#8220;Lucia di Lammermoor,&#8221;</a> featuring Diana Damrau and Joseph Calleja.</p>

    <p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/khanlou">Soroush Khanlou</a> and I are launching a new app named <a href="https://ashleynh.github.io/beacon-site/">Beacon</a>, that we’re hoping everyone in San Jose for WWDC will find invaluable. Beacon allows you to signal availability to your friends, people you follow on Twitter that also follow you back. We wanted to create a place for ad-hoc events to flourish. A space where anyone could say they're free now, headed to a session, or getting lunch – and make these events available for their friends to join. We also wanted to encourage extending beyond friend groups, so Beacon allows for creating and viewing public events in your area. Five weeks ago we decided to work on this idea, and I’m incredibly proud of the work we accomplished in such a short amount of time. Of course the app is written in Swift – Swift 3 to be exact – but the server <a href="http://khanlou.com/2017/06/beacon/">is written in Swift</a> too!</p>

<p>Beacon is an idea that's been in my head for a while, positioned to be specific for WWDC. We're treating this as an experiment to see if people find it as useful as we hope.</p>

<p>I want to thank everyone who beta tested the app with us and our partners for bearing with us while we spent long nights and weekends getting our app out the door. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/lindadong">Linda Dong</a> for her generous design contribution, and help positioning Beacon as a colorful and exciting place to connect with friends in the real world.</p>

    <p>In February, I spoke at <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/17/">Webstock</a>, a conference that takes place in Wellington, New Zealand. Video from my talk is <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/talks/humanities-x-technology/">now</a> available.</p>

<p>I spent two weeks in New Zealand and loved every minute. I'd heard New Zealand is a lovely country - "Have you seen Lord of The Rings?" -  but I wasn't prepared for how breathtakingly beautiful it is. At some point I stopped trying to take photos, because nothing accurately captured what I saw with my own two eyes.</p>

<p>During the first week of my trip, I was in Wellington for Webstock. The night before the conference started, the organizers planned a special event to welcome the speakers. I had an incredible time meeting and getting to know the brilliant professionals assembled by the organizers. Seriously, look at the <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/17/all-speakers/">lineup</a>. </p>

<p>The attendees at Webstock were one of the most gracious and thoughtful groups I've had the pleasure of speaking with post-talk, giving a high level of respect for my time and emotions. And best of all, I just felt comfortable in the space. Webstock is the rare tech conference with gender parity, a feat owed to the amazing job of the organizers.</p>

<p>After the conference, I went to the South Island, spending a week driving along the West Coast. The entire experience was an awesome adventure, one I'll cherish forever.</p>

<p>Thank you Webstock for an amazing conference and trip. It was an absolute honor and pleasure to be included.</p>

    <p>I started thinking about the history of my first PC recently while reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Valley-Birth-Personal-Computer/dp/1937785769/">Fire in the Valley</a>, a book on the history of the PC revolution. </p>

<p>On Christmas in 1995, I unwrapped a shiny new IBM Aptiva. Much to my delight, my mom had gifted me my first PC. </p>

<p>Each time I've thought about my mom making this purchase, it's been thru the lens of someone looking back in time. Reading Fire in the Valley reminded me that I'd never before put myself in my mom's perspective and thought about her making the decision within the context of being a parent without a technical background in 1995.</p>

<p>So, I asked my mom about the purchase. And since it's 2016, I asked over text message. Below is our conversation:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article_meta"><p>
      On 19 December 2016 at 07:26&thinsp;pm
      • Ashley Nelson
      
      
    </p></div>
    <p>I fixed a bug in a client's iOS app that I want to share, particularly because I couldn't find a write-up or solution during my research into the root cause of the problem.</p>

<p>The bug occurred during video playback. Each time the user tapped play, AVPlayer would first show the underlying view. This momentary transparency was not ideal, resulting in what amounted to a "camera flash" effect on the screen before each video was played.</p>

<p>I started debugging by first checking the app's configuration of AVPlayer, but I didn't spot an obvious issue. So I turned to Google, looking for a baseline of normal behavior for AVPlayer, and found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/AVBasicVideoOutput/Introduction/Intro.html">example code</a> Apple released in 2013.</p>

<p>Apple's sample project <sup id="ref1"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/fixing-avplayer-playback-transparency/#fn1">1</a></sup> plays a video selected from Camera Roll, and if you run it, you'll notice that playback occurs without a quick flash of transparency.</p>

<p>At this point, I knew something was wrong with the client's app, and not AVPlayer's API. But what was the culprit? I double-checked the configured properties for AVPlayer and AVPlayerItem, changing the client's app for parity between the two projects. But the bug persisted.</p>

<p>Taking a step back, I thought about the differences that remained between the two apps. Apple's example project played videos that were in Camera Roll, recorded using the Camera app. And the client's app played videos that were made in the client's app. </p>

<p>...wait a second. Was this the issue? Could the video file be the root of the problem and not AVPlayer?</p>

<p>To test this theory, I downloaded one of the videos made in the client's app, dropped it into Apple's example project, and made a couple of quick changes so that Apple's project would use the video I added instead of one selected from Camera Roll. I ran the project and <em>voilà</em>, the same initial flash of transparency reproduced in the example project.</p>

<p>At this point, it was obvious to me that the videos recorded in the client's app were at fault. Curious, I opened one of the client's app-created <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/99yio1985vq6snb/bad_video.mov?raw=1">videos</a> in Finder preview, and dragged the seek bar to the first frame. It was then that I noticed the first frame of the video was transparent, revealing <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/niuxslebimuvneq/finder.png?raw=1">the background</a> of Finder preview.<sup id="ref2"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/fixing-avplayer-playback-transparency/#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I looked at the client's code for creating videos and it seemed like a standard use of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation/avassetwriter">AVAssetWriter</a>, the class that writes media data to file. A call was made to</p>

<p><code>AVAssetWriter.startSession(atSourceTime:)</code> </p>

<p>to begin a file writing session, and then callbacks were received to the</p>

<p><code>AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate</code></p>

<p>With nothing obvious at fault in the code, I started reading the documentation for AVAssetWriter, and saw the following in the explanation for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation/avassetwriter/1389908-startsession">startSession(atSourceTime:)</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the earliest buffer for an input is later than startTime, an empty edit will be inserted to preserve synchronization between tracks of the output asset.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This "empty edit" sounded exactly like what was being inserted into the beginning of the client's app-created videos. I looked at how the client's app was appending buffers to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation/avassetwriterinput">AVAssetWriterInput</a> and noticed that the code never ensured the <strong>first</strong> buffer appended to the file had the same time as the <code>startTime</code> of the video. </p>

<p>As a fix, I added simple logic to ensure that the first buffer appended to a new video file always had the same time as the <code>sourceTime</code> passed to <code>AVAssetWriter.startSession(atSourceTime:)</code>. After this change was made, the client's app started producing videos like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3rempxq8i4g7t0/fixed_video.mov?raw=1">this</a> one.<sup id="ref3"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/fixing-avplayer-playback-transparency/#fn3">3</a></sup> Notice how it's initial frame is the opaque first frame of the video.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson reinforced here is to always break down complicated bugs by isolating their components into separate projects. Look for examples released by Apple, a respected developer, or create your own. I find this sanity check of knowing how a component or class behaves by default is always helpful in those moments when nothing seems to work.</p>

<hr />

<p><sup id="fn1">1. I was not excited when Apple announced Swift. I loved Objective-C. I was used to Objective-C. This test project was the first meaningful Objective-C code I worked with after several consecutive months of Swift development. Somewhere in that time, a shift in my thinking must have occurred, because using Objective-C suddenly felt bulky and kludgy in comparison. <a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/fixing-avplayer-playback-transparency/#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩&#xfe0e;</a></sup></p>

<p><sup id="fn2">2. Because the initial frame of the video is transparent, the background of whatever player you're using will be shown. In QuickTime, this initial frame will appear black. <a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/fixing-avplayer-playback-transparency/#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩&#xfe0e;</a>

    <p>The movie <a href="http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/hidden-figures">Hidden Figures</a> hits select theaters on Christmas Day. It tells the story of African-American mathematicians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson">Katherine Johnson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan">Dorothy Vaughan</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jackson_(engineer)">Mary Jackson</a>, who worked at NASA in the 1960s. Their work helped John Glenn become the first American astronaut to make a complete orbit of the Earth.</p>

<p>For many, this will be the first time they've heard of these women, or the fact that African-American women worked at NASA in a scientific capacity in the 1950s. In fact, all of the stars of the film, including Taraji P. Henson, who plays Katherine Johnson, Janelle Monae, who plays Mary Jackson, and Octavia Spencer, who plays Dorothy Vaughan, assumed the script they were reading was a work of fiction. As Spencer said in an interview “Black women being recruited to work as mathematicians at NASA’s southern installation defies what we think we know about American history.”</p>

<p>In a previous piece named <a href="http://blog.ashleynh.me/on-heroes">On Heroes</a>, I wrote about this exact issue while discussing another of NASA's African-American mathematicians, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Easley">Annie Jean Easley</a>. In the piece, I mention how an African-American astronaut I <a href="https://twitter.com/ashleynh/status/612002097920258048">met</a> hadn't heard of Easley, one of her predecessors. Of special import is the reaction my astronaut friend had upon finding out about Easley's existence, as the disappointment of feeling denied a role model washed over her face. Why do we bury these important figures whose contributions make black and brown girls feel like they have a future in STEM? Why do we bury these stories that expand the possibilities for what black and brown girls feel like they can achieve?</p>

<p>I said it before and I'll say it again: Having visible examples of people that look like you in an aspirational professional field is powerful. They matter. That's why I'm excited about this movie, and the attention it's getting from a national advertising campaign. As a bonus, it's Christmas Day release is a sign of potential Oscar Buzz, giving me hope this movie will be as excellent as I want it to be, and that the conversation around it will continue well into February.</p>

<p>The only way positive, diverse stories get told to a mainstream audience is when the economics make sense. I'll be at the theatre opening day to see this film and I'm encouraging everyone I know to go too. Please show your support.</p>

    <p>Today I'm flying to St. Louis for <a href="http://www.thestrangeloop.com">Strange Loop</a> to deliver one of the keynote talks.</p>

<p>For my keynote, I've expanded my talk on the intersection of humanities and technology, doubling its length to include more examples. I've also refined my pitch to value the humanity of the people who interact with your products as highly as the product's technical details.</p>

<p>I imagine Strange Loop will be quite a different experience from the iOS/Mac community focused conferences I generally attend. This conference brings together a broad, multi-disciplinary group of tech workers from a variety of specialties. As a result, I only know a couple of people attending ahead of time. I'm cherishing the moment to meet people outside of my own specialty, and looking forward to giving my keynote to a wider audience.</p>

    <p>In two weeks, I'm giving the keynote talk at this year's <a href="http://360idev.com">360iDev</a>, held in Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p>For my keynote, I've expanded my talk on the intersection of humanities and technology, nearly doubling its length. This expansion accommodates more examples, and refines my pitch for valuing the humanity of the people who will use your product, as highly as the product's technical details.</p>

<p>360iDev may be the largest indie iOS/Mac developer conference I've ever attended, with up to four talks running in the same time slot. One of the reasons I'm looking forward to the conference is how easy coordinating with <a href="https://twitter.com/jwilker">John Wilker</a>, one of the organizers of 360iDev, has been. I'm expecting a very well run event, to catch up with old friends, meet new ones, and explore a new city.</p>

    <p>Earlier this month I was interviewed by Guy English and Rene Ritchie, hosts of the Debug podcast. We discussed: <a href="http://soundofftech.org">Sound Off</a>, the tech tinkering I did as a kid, how that led to a job at Apple, and being a developer in Apple's ecosystem who didn't grow up idolizing Jobs or Apple. I also got a chance to explain my process for putting together a talk. You can find the episode on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/debug/id578812394?mt=2">iTunes</a>.</p>

    <p>Last week I returned home from <a href="http://www.uikonf.com">UIKonf</a>, a conference I spoke at in Berlin, Germany. UIKonf is the first conference I've attended that provided live captioning for physically present attendees. In this context, live captioning meant that a large TV screen was on the side of the stage, with a scrolling real-time transcription of each talk. I knew before I arrived at UIKonf that there would be live captioning. In fact, my non-profit <a href="http://soundofftech.org">Sound Off</a>, raised over $3k in April to pay for it, contracting with <a href="http://www.whitecoatcaptioning.com">White Coat Captioning</a> to perform the transcription. That said, as an able-bodied person who never attended a conference with live captioning before, I didn't think I would notice a difference. Boy, was I naive.</p>

<p>At first, I enjoyed watching the captions scroll, or checking to see whether the words matched what the speaker said. Within hours, the live caption screen became an invaluable tool that I'd glance at several times during a talk. If there was a word I couldn't hear or a speaker had an accent I was having trouble understanding, I didn't have to resign myself to waiting for the video. No, I could simply glance at the screen and pick up the missing words. Similarly, if my attention drifted to the many items on my to-do list or I just <em>had</em> to check my phone and I stopped actively listening, the transcription always helped me get back into the context and flow of the talk.</p>

<p>Much to my delight, <a href="https://twitter.com/ranterle/status/734666422316617728">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/olebegemann/status/735133724992524289">attendees</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/agnoster/status/734656925024018436">also</a> noticed how awesome the live caption screen was, and felt that live captions were a helpful addition. I sincerely hope every conference I attend in the future has live captioning. It enriches the experience for in-person attendees, regardless of physical ability. In fact, when I'm invited to speak moving forward, I'll be asking organizers if they plan to provide live captioning.</p>

    <p><em>This article was originally published in Model View Culture's 2015 Quarterly No. 3</em></p>

<p>I recently participated in a panel on how to be an effective engineer for Code2040, a nonprofit organization striving to close the achievement gap by providing pathways for minorities to have successful careers in technology. The audience was a group of engineering interns, all from underrepresented backgrounds and working in the Bay Area for the summer. During the panel, I was asked to name something that has had the largest impact on my career success thus far. I said confidence, a response that was intentionally abstract.</p>

<p>Marginalized tech workers are often told they need to do more in order to achieve the successes of the majority or get the same treatment. Directives such as "Lean In!", "Negotiate!", "Network!", and "Find Mentors!" are preached heavily. It's as if doing one or all of these things will help make up for some sort of innate deficiency that is preventing marginalized tech workers from benefitting in a system the majority say is a meritocracy. Although this is a comforting fairy tale - because who doesn't want to believe that marginalized people are one behavioral adjustment from prosperity - it disregards the very nuanced privileges that enable majority people to be ambitious without fear of blowback. In other words, it's irresponsible to tell a marginalized person to apply a "one size fits all" strategy to their career. These strategies are recommended with good intentions, but without a clear blueprint or the acknowledgement that applying one may not yield the same benefit, most of this direction feels out of touch. Why is it always incumbent upon the marginalized to fix themselves in order to be treated with respect?</p>

<h3 id="whydoesconfidencematter">Why Does Confidence Matter?</h3>

<p>Our confidence is tested throughout life. It can be incredibly difficult to believe in yourself, and have unquantifiable knowledge of your worthiness when colleagues have low expectations of your technical abilities. Marianne Williamson's famous quote "...who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous?" resonates. The tech field is a breeding ground for imposter syndrome. The more underrepresented you are, the larger the feeling you don't belong. </p>

<p>For marginalized tech workers, confidence doesn't manifest as projecting an ability to do something you can’t really do, or a lack of basic self-awareness. Marginalized people have plenty of self-awareness. We're constantly reminded at work that we exist on the fringe of the culture. Well-meaning colleagues invite us to opportunities based on our minority status, damaging our self-esteem and making us question our qualifications. As great as diversity in technology initiatives by companies can be, they also come dangerously close to insinuating that the very people they hope to attract are only there because “diversity.” Confidence for the marginalized looks a lot like simply believing you deserve a seat at the table, and have earned it through ability instead of filling a recruiting quota. </p>

<p>Subconsciously, confidence is the thread underlying your decision-making and behavior. Confident tech workers have an inner belief that they can learn, grow, and understand technical concepts. As a result, they approach difficult problems as a positive learning experience - regardless of outcome. Because they are secure in their abilities, confident tech workers don't worry about the optics of looking bad when they're wrong - so they readily admit mistakes. Being secure makes them unafraid to ask for help when needed. And when they do ask for help, confident tech workers expect to understand the explanation provided. In fact, they'll continue asking questions until they receive an explanation that makes sense to them. Confident tech workers know their ideas are worthwhile, so they speak to colleagues at a calm, relaxed pace. And most important, they recognize the tremendous value they bring to an organization - so they ensure a commensurate compensation. This is not the piece that tells marginalized tech workers to simply "be more confident," because I don't want to imply that it's easy. </p>

<h3 id="howhasconfidencebeenbuiltinmyownlife">How Has Confidence Been Built In My Own Life?</h3>

<p>I responded confidence to the panel prompt, because it has been the driving force behind my most important career decisions. Actually, it would be more correct to say that confidence has affected every single interaction - interpersonal or otherwise - that I've had at work. Unsurprisingly, I've been most effective as an engineer when I've believed in myself. After a few years of working at Apple, I knew I wanted the challenge of working with a small team of people focused on delivering a consumer-facing product. But self-doubt began to creep into my thoughts, and I questioned whether I was a strong enough engineer to be a meaningful contributor to a startup. Fortunately, I had a couple of experienced friends that believed I would be a great asset to a small team, in spite of the worrisome words coming out of my mouth. I respected each of them, so their encouragement forced me to believe in myself. </p>

<p>Surrounding myself with a great community of people has been one of the best assets to building my confidence. Whether you call them friends, partners, mentors, or coaches - it's imperative to have access to people that you can relate to, who believe in your abilities and allow you to lean on them for support. My support network helps me to recharge from the stresses of being a marginalized tech worker by allowing me to vent frustrations, express worries, and relax in their presence. When I feel the loneliness of being a marginalized tech worker, these individuals remind me that I'm not in uncharted territory. They also serve the important role of helping to rebuild my confidence in those destructive moments of self-doubt. Knowing that I have their support and advice helps me feel a sense of security.</p>

<p>Another way that I've helped to build my confidence is by adopting a growth mindset. Recognizing that engineering is a skill and therefore one that I can improve upon is a relatively new mindset shift for me. My introduction to programming started with the book "C++ in 21 Days" when I was in 6th grade. Being the type-A kid that I was, I decided that I was going to learn C++ in exactly 21 days. Though I had no idea what C++ was, I was doing a good job learning it until I got to "Day 8" - pointers. Up to that point in my life, school was easy. Yet here was this book with concepts in it that felt like a brick wall preventing me from moving on to the next day! I began to feel like I didn't possess the natural talent to excel as a programmer. </p>

<p>Years later, when I did well in programming classes in high school and college, a part of me was dismissive of those results. Because of that initial experience programming, I was subconsciously held back by the fear of finding another brick wall concept that I wouldn't be able to grasp. It's taken a decade to reverse this thinking and stop having a fixed mindset about my engineering abilities, but it's been worth the effort. Now, because I believe that I can grow as an engineer, I'm motivated to invest in myself. The intrinsic belief that I can get better keeps me confidently striving in my career for more responsibility and new challenges.</p>

<p>After the initial panic that comes with taking on a new professional challenge, I deal with the accompanying stress, anxiety, and self-doubt by managing the one thing in my control - my preparation. In October 2014, I did my first technical talk in Moscow, Russia. Though the opportunity terrified me and had me questioning everything, including whether I was qualified to give the talk and whether the audience would listen to a marginalized tech worker - I knew it was something I needed to try. To cope with the self-doubt, I made sure that the delivery of my content was as good as possible by practicing relentlessly. Knowing that I had all thirty-five minutes of my talk memorized gave me the personal internal comfort that I could handle some of the possible failure scenarios in my head. When it did come time to present, one of those failure scenarios actually manifested. The large in-stage monitor with my presentation notes flickered in and out before turning off for long periods of time. But because I had over-prepared, I was able to calmly hide this technical glitch from the audience and deliver my talk as rehearsed.</p>

<p>Finally, it's important to recognize the importance of scheduling time for yourself, to do things you enjoy outside of work. I know that I feel my best and most confident when I stay active, so I foster habits like eating healthy and working out. I've noticed that setting and diligently pursuing my personal training milestones gives me the feeling that I can similarly pursue and accomplish my professional goals. In short, doing things outside of work that make you feel better, can actually make you feel better about work. Figure out what brings you joy and makes you feel good about yourself, then set aside time, and go do those activities. </p>

<h3 id="howcanyoubuildtheconfidenceofthosearoundyou">How Can You Build the Confidence of Those Around You?</h3>

<p>The culture at work plays a significant role in the confidence of marginalized tech workers. I have worked in environments before where I felt like I couldn't be wrong or admit that I wasn't familiar with a technical concept because of the physical displays of dismissiveness, like deep sighing, I received from my bosses. I've also felt as though I had a very limited number of mistakes that I could make before people stopped respecting my professional technical opinion. And I knew that I had exceeded the number of allowed mistakes when I began to get undermined constantly. Instead of respecting my opinion, my bosses would ask me to validate my conclusions by seeking out the professional opinions of majority tech workers in their network. This combination of low expectations for technical ability, and constant second-guessing creates toxic, unwelcoming environments. </p>

<p>Afford marginalized colleagues the same respect given to majority workers by default. Assume your co-workers from underrepresented backgrounds possess domain expertise in the roles they were hired to fill. Be more supportive friends and colleagues by being open to their feedback, and believing their experiences. Acknowledge the additional stress and cognitive overhead that your colleagues may be experiencing because they're underrepresented, and ask how they could feel more welcome at work.</p>

<p>Finally, avoid inviting marginalized colleagues to partake in an opportunity because of their minority status. I understand that these invitations are well-intentioned, but saying "we need more of (your marginalized group), would you like to attend?" is not only lazy, it's offensive. That message has done two things. It's reduced the invitee to feeling like they don't have any qualifications beyond being from an underrepresented background, and it's put a burden on their choice of whether to accept. If the opportunity is worthwhile, the marginalized tech worker will struggle with whether to accept and deal with the guilt of feeling like they received an undeserved benefit, or decline an otherwise good career move. Instead of leading an event invitation with a mention of how the invitee will improve the diversity of the lineup, why not mention all of the great work that person has done to get themselves noticed in the first place. Yes, marginalized tech workers are from underrepresented backgrounds - but stop making this the focus of the pitch.</p>

<p class="ornaments">P</p>

<p>There is no one thing that can be done to make the industry better for marginalized tech workers, but by cultivating a supportive network, adopting a growth mindset, focusing on preparation, and taking care of ourselves outside of work, we have a better chance of confidently facing the challenges ahead.</p>

    <p>I joined the Board of Directors for <a href="http://soundofftech.org">Sound Off</a>, a non-profit (paperwork pending) I've <a href="http://ashleynh.me/sound-off-round-1-alterconf/">mentioned</a> before. I love that Sound Off works to increase the access marginalized people in tech have to professional opportunities. It's a natural fit for my interests and something I'm just as passionate about.</p>

<p>Sound Off's second campaign is happening now. We're fundraising to provide live captioning for UIKonf, "an independent conference in Berlin, Germany focusing on iOS development. Live captioning for UIKonf is not only going to open up the conference to the deaf community and the hard of hearing, but will be indispensable for many of the attendees for whom English is not their first language." </p>

<p>Take a few moments to check out the public <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/sound-off-uikonf">campaign</a>.</p>

<p>UIKonf takes place this year from May 22nd to May 25th, and I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be speaking at the conference. I've never been to Germany before, so tips are appreciated. If you're in town, come say hi!</p>

    <p>When I left Dropbox, I said I wanted to focus on building products from scratch. That desire hasn't changed, but my anticipated venue has. Startups pivot. Business models and priorities change quickly, seemingly overnight. When paths diverge and there are two different goals, it doesn't make sense to move forward just for the sake of appearances.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm remote contracting for the first time in my career. I like the freedom of managing my own schedule, and making sure I fit in time for the gym and reading. Most of all, I'm enjoying ramping up on Swift by working on apps with real deadlines. If you need a contract iOS engineer, please reach out.</p>

<p>The most exciting news I have to share is that I'm in the beginning stages of a new project with a very talented designer friend of mine. We've been interested in working together for a while and the timing is perfect. As the project matures, I look forward to charting our technical progress on this blog.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson I've learned since leaving Dropbox is that I don't need to wait until I gain this or that experience, I'm ready to start my own venture right now.</p>

    <p>Late last year I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Steve-Jobs-Evolution-Visionary/dp/0385347405">Becoming Steve Jobs</a>, the unauthorized biography of Steve Jobs, written by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli. For those keeping track of Jobs biographies, this was the book publicly endorsed by current Apple leadership, with input from Jobs' widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, and his closest friends. Though there are two authors, the narrative is written from the perspective of Schlender, who lends credibility to the book with his twenty-five year professional and at times personal relationship with Jobs. Admittedly, I never got around to reading the official biography by Walter Isaacson, partly because enough people I respected decried the book and it's author for not understanding Jobs' technological achievements. With Schlender, I didn't have those same concerns, because he spent his career covering Jobs as a tech writer for the Wall Street Journal and Fortune.</p>

<p>I wasn't particularly interested in Apple growing up. In fact, I didn't own my first Mac until after I interned at Apple. For someone like me, who was too young to have witnessed or wasn't paying attention to most of Jobs' career, it's easy to lionize Jobs. It's easy to view Jobs as this fully-formed genius, who was born with the right tools to achieve greatness. As <em>Becoming Steve Jobs</em> shows, this was not at all the case. Jobs matured into the innovative leader he's remembered as, through trial and error. He failed, a lot. But he never allowed those failures to cause him to question his own judgement. Too often, instead of listening to my gut and inner voice, I seek the opinions of others to validate my decisions. One of the things I admire about Jobs is how strongly he believed in himself.</p>

<p>Jobs' ouster from Apple is depicted as the best thing to have happened to his career. I expected the narrative to focus on Jobs founding NeXT and how that led to his triumphant return to Apple. But the authors don't look favorably on this venture. At NeXT we see that Jobs is making the same mistakes that marked the end of his first stint at Apple, building an unfocused product without a market. Instead, the authors credit Jobs' purchase of Pixar as having taught him to be a great leader. It's at Pixar that Jobs learns how to manage creative people, through his friendships with Ed Catmull<sup id="ref1"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/becoming-steve-jobs/#fn1">1</a></sup>, President, and John Lassetter, Chief Creative Officer. Sure, Jobs had the foresight to purchase Pixar, and not give up on the company. He also negotiated Disney's acquisition of Pixar to secure its future. Largely though, credit is given to Catmull for effectively managing Jobs into allowing Pixar to operate autonomously. Providing these depictions and insights is where the book shines.</p>

<p>That said, I have a few criticisms. Contributions from those who best knew Jobs vary in effectiveness. When used to bring the narrative to life, the resulting exposition is among the best the book has to offer. My favorite chapter, for example, tells the story of the day Jobs delivered his great commencement speech at Stanford University, from the perspective of Laurene. I don't want to spoil the story, but it's funny, highlights a lesser-known side of Jobs, and reflects the level of effort he gave to his work. Similarly, Eddy Cue and Jony Ive's anecdotes about their first days working with Jobs are enjoyable to read. </p>

<p>In contrast, Tim Cook's quotes have an agenda that feels out of place. Cook uses the book as a platform to defend his friend against Isaacson's portrayal. In fact, there are two full pages of consecutive quotes that read like a soliloquy, without narrative structure. A curious moment also occurs when Cook explains Jobs' part in the lawsuit against Silicon Valley companies, for their secret and illegal agreement not to poach senior employees from one another. Cook says in part "...I don't think he was thinking about saving any money. He was just very protective of his employees." I was surprised to hear such a patriarchal sentiment from the CEO of Apple. I get that he's defending his friend, but Jobs' actions were illegal, so the defense comes off tone-deaf.</p>

<p>I also thought some of Jobs' flaws were glossed over. A single page was devoted to the strained relationship Jobs had with his first daughter Lisa, after initially denying paternity. Given what I already knew, and the book's admission that "when people debate whether Steve was a 'good' or 'bad' man, this is the strongest indictment against him," I expected more insight to be provided.</p>

<p>Finally, the pronoun "he" is used throughout the book to describe a hypothetical person or the reader. I greatly prefer when authors choose to evenly switch between pronouns. The singular use of "he" took me out of the reading, like a constant reminder that I'm not a part of the intended audience for the book.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed reading <em>Becoming Steve Jobs</em>. In Silicon Valley, successful young co-founders are put on a pedestal, which makes it easy to view these people as born leaders. By his 20s, Jobs' early success made him a celebrity, but in the book we find out that he wasn't a great leader until his return to Apple in his 40s. A thread of growth connects the book from beginning to end. And so now I view Jobs less like a folklore hero, and more like a deeply flawed person who became a visionary leader.</p>

    <p>I recently shattered the screen of my iPhone 6S. Since then, every Apple fan I've spoken with has asked me if I have AppleCare+, and each has given me the same pitying look of sympathy when I say no. "You should really get that," they say. Well, today I looked at the numbers and I still don't see a point to Apple's warranty program for iPhones.</p>

<p>AppleCare+ can be purchased for an iPhone 6S at $129. With it, comes discounted pricing for two<sup id="ref1"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/applecare-plus/#fn1">1</a></sup> incidents of accidental damage. An iPhone 6S screen repair, for example, costs $99 on AppleCare+ and $129 without. </p>

<p>Had I purchased AppleCare+, my screen repair would have been $228<sup id="ref2"><a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/applecare-plus/#fn2">2</a></sup>, instead of $129. If I were to damage my phone's screen a second time, yes that would cost me $99 on AppleCare+. But that's $99 on top of the $228 I've already paid, or $327. Without AppleCare+, the same two screen repairs cost $258.</p>

<p>AppleCare+ only starts to make fiscal sense when you need to replace the entire phone. At that point, it costs the same $228 for the first incident, instead of $299 without AppleCare+. I'd rather keep my money with me, instead of anticipating a need to replace my entire phone.</p>

<hr />

<p><sup id="fn1">1. Meaning that by the third incident, you've lost out on discounted repairs. <a href="http://ashleynh.me:80/applecare-plus/#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩&#xfe0e;</a></sup></p>

    <p>Today is my last day at Dropbox.</p>

<p>I joined Dropbox two years ago. At the time, it was incredibly important to me to find the right culture fit. I wanted a team that had women engineers and fostered a collaborative, friendly environment. I’d recently left a startup where I was the only iOS engineer, so most of all I wanted a team with other iOS engineers that I could teach and learn from (read: nerd out with). To my pleasant surprise, I found all of that at Dropbox.</p>

<p>My time at Dropbox has been a tremendous period of growth for me. I’ve done more public speaking, worked on a large codebase with millions of users, and helped to shape how the company prioritizes accessibility moving forward. In short, I've had an amazing two years. </p>

<p>I’m leaving Dropbox to ensure that I continue to challenge myself. One day I want to lead the technical implementation of a venture I co-found. In order to get there, I need to fill the gaps that exist in my experience. The two most important areas I want to grow in are building a product from scratch, and providing technical leadership to a team of engineers. That’s why I’m thrilled to announce that I’ll be starting at <a href="https://www.glassbreakers.co">Glassbreakers</a> on March 1st. Glassbreakers doesn’t currently have a mobile app, and I’m looking forward to bringing a product from idea to market.</p>
