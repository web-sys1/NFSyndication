------------

You can install package through the line command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install NFSyndication

*Alternatively you can install it form source code (with git prefix):* ``pip install git+https://github.com/web-sys1/NFSyndication.git``


Usage
-----
Put a list of feed URLs in ``feeds.txt`` file. One feed per line. 

Run the command:

.. code:: bash

   nfsyndication-src
   
Otherwise, you should do that through **Python** code:

.. code:: python

  import NFSyndication
  from NFSyndication import main as NFS_init

  def entry_point():
    """ We use these conditions to check the statement"""
    subscriptions = [
     'http://feedpress.me/512pixels',
     'http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/feed/',
     'http://ihnatko.com/feed/',
     'http://blog.ashleynh.me/feed',
     'http://www.betalogue.com/feed/',
      ...
     ]
  
    with open(f'feeds.txt', 'w', encoding='utf8') as f:
     f.write(",".join(subscriptions).replace(',', '\n'))
    return NFS_init()

  """Then initialize code."""
  entry_point()

Bug fix
-------

After many hours of working to development, it was set up an way of path
configuration due to errors. Meanwhile, we have to set code
``os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))`` with the globalization
of variables for source code in this package. If you encounter a problem, please report `here <https://github.com/web-sys1/NFSyndication/issues/new>`_.
